It consists of a body for burning incense and a lid sculpted in the form of a kneeling kirin, a mythical creature. The body flares outward at the top and is supported by three animal-shaped legs. Cloud patterns adorn the body and its rim, with the lid placed atop. The center of the lid features a kirin turning its head backward, its seat engraved with lightning patterns. The kirin's horn is broken, its mane rendered in curly details, and its eyes accented with black pigment dots. Structurally, incense smoke is designed to escape through the open mouth of the kirin. The burner is enveloped in a subtle, jade-green glaze characteristic of the period, exuding elegance. During the 12th century, when celadon glazes reached their zenith, such symbolic animal- and plant-shaped celadons were widely produced.",

Measuring 42.1 cm in height with a mouth diameter of 6.2 cm and base diameter of 17 cm, the vase features a small, low, slightly flared rim and broad, imposing shoulders. A floral band encircles the area below the rim, while a lotus pattern adorns the base. The central body displays intricate inlaid cloud and crane motifs: within black-and-white inlaid circular compartments, cranes ascend amid clouds, while outside these circles, cranes descend toward the lower section. This dynamic arrangement—alternating upward and downward crane movements—creates an illusion of spatial freedom beyond the vessel's physical constraints, reflecting Goryeo artisans' innovative approach to composition. The technical mastery and creative expression evident in the design underscore the sophistication and artistic ingenuity of Goryeo celadon craftsmanship.",

It comprises a body for burning incense and a lid shaped like a crouching lion. The body is supported by three animal-shaped legs adorned with finely carved cloud patterns on its surface, with additional cloud motifs arranged at three points along the upper rim. The lid depicts a lion seated on a pedestal decorated with floral patterns. The lion's posture, slightly shifted to the left, creates a dynamic visual effect. It is shown with its mouth open, one knee bent, and eyes rendered with black dots to represent pupils. Swirling patterns mimic the lion's mane at the back of its neck and hips, while its tail is raised and pressed against its back. The glaze exhibits a pale greenish-blue hue with a subtle, lustrous sheen. Structurally, the incense smoke from the body is designed to escape through the lion's open mouth, showcasing the refined craftsmanship of celadon incense burners from this period. During the early 12th century, when jade-green celadon reached its zenith, many symbolic celadon works modeled after auspicious animals and plants were produced. Notably, lion-shaped incense burners were particularly acclaimed by Song dynasty scholars for their exceptional artistry.",

Originally located on Bongdae Peak in Bukhansan, it was relocated to Gyeongbokgung Palace for preservation and is now housed in the National Museum of Korea. The stele is made of a rectangularly carved stone, erected on a two-tiered platform atop a natural rock base. The upper portion is partially missing, with the remaining body measuring 1.54 meters in height and 69 cm in width. The inscription consists of 12 lines, each containing 32 characters in regular script (haeseo), detailing the king's purpose for visiting the region and the reasons for erecting the stele. The text predominantly praises King Jinheung's territorial expansions. Although the exact date of construction remains uncertain due to eroded inscriptions, it is estimated to have been erected between 561 (the year of the Changnyeong Stele) and 568 (the year of the Hwangchoryeong Stele) during King Jinheung's reign. The stele was discovered and deciphered by scholar Kim Jeong-hui (Jeong-hee) in 1816, during the Joseon Dynasty, and remains a critical historical resource for studying the Three Kingdoms period.",

The body features raised scales and large pectoral fins carved in relief at the center. The handle, modeled after a lotus stem, curves naturally over the body, while the lid replicates a fish's tail fin. The jade-green glaze harmonizes with intricate incised patterns on the fins and floral motifs, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship.

Originally used in Buddhist rituals to symbolically cleanse evil, the water bottle was a vessel introduced to Korea via China from Western styles, but reached its most refined form during the Goryeo period. This masterpiece stands out among such artifacts with its serene jade-green glaze of a pale greenish-blue hue, adorned solely with white slip inlay depicting willows, reeds, lotus blossoms, and a pair of mandarin ducks arranged in a pictorial composition. The neck features a peony flower inlaid on each side. The spout, designed in an octagonal shape, is elegantly crafted and stands vertically atop the neck. The pouring mouth, round and modestly attached to one side of the shoulder, originally had a lid that is now lost. Early inlaid celadon pieces from this period are characterized by their meticulously refined glaze and clay body, with the jade-green glaze enhancing their sophistication. The addition of inlaid patterns further elevated their decorative appeal. This water bottle exemplifies the highly refined and elegant style of early Goryeo inlaid celadon craftsmanship.",

Published in 1448 (30th year of Sejong's reign), it comprises six volumes and six books in metal type. Contrasted with the Chinese rhyme book Hongmu Zhengyun, 'Dongguk Jeongun' means 'Correct Sounds of the Eastern Kingdom,' reflecting its purpose to unify and standardize chaotic Hanja pronunciations in Korea. Completed in September 1447, it was distributed to institutions like Sungkyunkwan by November 1448. Only Volumes 1 and 6 survive today. The main text uses woodblock characters, while smaller text and preface employ Gabinja type; the large characters are based on the handwriting of Grand Prince Jinyang. This work holds immense significance as Korea's first systematic documentation of Hanja pronunciation in its own phonetic system, rivaling Hunminjeongeum in linguistic value.

It serves as a crucial resource for studying both the stylistic characteristics of the enshrined Buddha and the architectural trends of the period. This particular shrine, standing 18cm tall, is crafted from bronze with a gilded surface. Inside, a square base surrounded by a railing supports the main Buddha triad—comprising the principal Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas—covered by a roofed structure resembling a Buddhist hall. The hall-shaped lid features large windows on the front and sides, allowing clear visibility of the enshrined statues. The principal Buddha has an abstract facial expression, with robes draped over both shoulders rendered in simplified linear folds. The mandorla (light halo) behind the Buddha is divided into a head halo and a body halo, adorned with flame patterns along the edges. The bodhisattvas on either side, except for their beaded crowns, share similar stylistic and technical features with the principal Buddha. The shrine remains in excellent condition, with its golden luster still vibrant and traces of green patina on the roof. Based on stylistic elements such as the elongated torso of the principal Buddha, irregular robe folds, and the beaded crowns of the bodhisattvas, it is estimated to have been created in the 11th–12th century under the influence of Northern Chinese traditions. This artifact holds significant value as a rare example illustrating wooden architectural styles and sculptural techniques from the Goryeo period or earlier.",

      "content_en": "This statue depicts a bodhisattva seated on a throne with the right leg crossed over the left, the right elbow resting on the knee, and the fingers of the right hand touching the cheek. Standing 80 cm tall, it was acquired by a Japanese individual in 1912 and donated to the Japanese Government-General of Korea. It was transferred to the Government-General Museum in 1916 and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The bodhisattva wears an elaborate crown with two strands of ornamentation cascading down to the shoulders. The square-shaped face, with prominent cheekbones and a recessed mouth, exudes a plump, serene smile. The upper body is robust and erect, while the lower body exhibits graceful curves. The hands and feet are disproportionately large compared to the slender limbs and physique. The overall form is elastic, smooth, and rhythmic, enhancing the statue's elegant aura. The celestial garment drapes over the shoulders, flares upward like bird feathers, flows down the chest, crosses at the left leg, wraps around the knees and arms. The skirt, slightly thick, features skillfully carved U-shaped folds. The elliptical lotus pedestal beneath the left foot is engraved with lotus patterns, though the halo at the back of the head is missing. Radiographic analysis in 1963 revealed no internal defects or repairs, with the material and craftsmanship noted as highly unusual. The balanced posture, beautiful drapery, and enigmatic meditative expression suggest it is a masterpiece of Korean Buddhist art, likely created in the mid-6th century or shortly thereafter.",

The robe drapes both shoulders, featuring a V-shaped fold at the front and feather-like trailing edges on either side. The right hand is raised with palm facing forward and fingers pointing upward, while the left hand, also palm-forward, has two fingers bent downward—a distinctive gesture.

Their robes cross in an X-pattern at the front, and their hand gestures differ from the principal Buddha. The halo, adorned with flame patterns in fine lines, has a pointed boat shape. Around the principal Buddha, the halo is divided into a circular head halo and rectangular body halo, intricately carved with lotus, vine, and grapevine motifs. The pedestal, a flared cylindrical base, is engraved with lotus designs. Stylistically similar to the National Treasure Gilt-bronze Sinmyo Buddha Triad, this statue follows the iconography of the Northern and Southern Dynasties of China.

Despite the dynasty's policy of promoting Confucianism and suppressing Buddhism, it remained a protected important temple until 1504, when King Yeonsan converted it into a brothel named Yeonbangwon (聯芳院), expelling the monks and leading to the temple's demise. This pagoda is the only one of its kind from the Joseon period, standing approximately 12 meters tall.

The pagoda's body comprises ten stories: the first three tiers retain the 'Asia' shape, while the upper seven form a square plan. Each story meticulously replicates wooden architectural elements, including roofs, bracketing systems (hyungja), and pillars. Unlike most Korean stone pagodas made of granite, this marble structure closely resembles the 10-story stone pagoda of Gyeongcheonsa Temple from the Goryeo period, drawing significant attention.

Both figures are mounted on short-legged horses atop thick rectangular bases. The horse's hindquarters feature a lamp with a hole, and a protruding spout on the chest allows water to be poured through the hollow body. The master figure wears a triangular hat adorned with a band and decorations, along with lattice-patterned trousers, reflecting elaborate horse trappings. The servant figure has a topknot wrapped in a headband, a bare upper body, a burden on its back, and holds a bell-like object in the right hand, suggesting a role as a guide. These ceramics provide critical insights into Silla-era spiritual beliefs, clothing, weaponry, horse gear, and artistic design.",

      "content_en": "This Buddhist statue, discovered in 1930 in Bongsan-ri, Hwacheon-myeon, Goksan-gun, Hwanghae-do, is currently housed at the Leeum Museum of Art. Standing 15.5 cm tall, it is a triad (three-bodied Buddha) carved on a single large halo (광배), with the central Buddha flanked by smaller bodhisattvas on either side. It is the largest extant statue of this format. The flanking bodhisattvas are significantly smaller, appearing almost dangling at the edges of the halo, which accentuates the prominence of the central Buddha. Apart from minor scratches on the Buddha's chest and the halo's right edge, the overall preservation is excellent.\n\nThe central Buddha has a plump face with a subtle smile, a large usnisa (육계, topknot), and thick robes covering the shoulders and extending to the ankles. The right hand is raised with the palm facing outward, while the left hand is lowered, palm downward. The halo, detachable from the statue, is fixed via a protruding spike on the back of the Buddha. Shaped like a boat (배 모양), the halo features a head halo and body halo around the Buddha, adorned with lotus, vine, and morning glory patterns. Flame motifs frame the edges, with small Buddha figures between the sections. The two attendant bodhisattvas at the halo's base have large faces and slender, cylindrical bodies, with X-shaped robe patterns on their chests. Their craftsmanship appears less refined compared to the central Buddha.\n\nAn inscription on the halo's reverse records that five individuals commissioned the statue to honor their teacher and parents. Stylistic and epigraphic analysis suggests it is a Goguryeo work, with the inscribed year 'Sinmyo' (辛卯) corresponding to 571 CE (13th year of King Pyeongwon's reign). While the statue's overall form—characterized by a large face, abstract body, and hand gestures—follows the style of the National Treasure Gilt-Bronze Standing Buddha from Yeonga 7th Year, it exhibits a softer, more refined aesthetic compared to the earlier piece's robust vigor.",

      "content_en": "This 20.7 cm tall gilt-bronze statue of a standing bodhisattva was discovered in 1967 in Samyang-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul, and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The statue exhibits a crack above the ankle and a partially detached left robe. The bodhisattva wears a triangular crown adorned with a small Buddha image and has a rounded, serene face with a faint smile. The narrow shoulders and protruding abdomen create a curved silhouette reminiscent of a bow when viewed from the side. Thick robes draped in a U-shape around the waist and knees obscure the leg contours, with simplified linear folds. The right hand holds a flask (vase), while the left hand extends upward with the thumb and index finger forming a straight V-shape—a distinctive gesture. The lotus pedestal features inverted petals with sharp tips, contrasting the statue's softness. Identified as Avalokiteshvara due to the triangular crown with a Buddha image and the flask, the statue's plump facial features, body proportions, and U-shaped drapery suggest a creation date in the early 7th century. It serves as a critical artifact illustrating the prevalence of Avalokiteshvara veneration during the late Three Kingdoms period.",

The square-like face lacks a smile, imparting a solemn expression. The thin robe clings closely to the body, subtly revealing bodily contours, though the garment's folds are not sharply defined. Bead decorations descending from the shoulders cross in an X-shape near the abdomen and extend down the legs, with a round floral medallion at the center—a motif influenced by ancient Chinese styles also seen in Three Kingdoms period gilt-bronze Buddhist statues. The right hand holds the robe's hem, while the left clasps a large water pot (jingbi), identifying the figure as Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. The hexagonal pedestal features an inverted lotus pattern at the base and an open lotus motif above, with broad, softly carved petals distinctive of Baekje craftsmanship. Despite extensive oxidation, the statue retains a vibrant golden hue and embodies the graceful elegance characteristic of Baekje Buddhist sculptures.",

Currently, the pedestal (daeza) on which the Bodhisattva once stood and the crown (gwan) it wore are missing, and the left hand has broken off at the forearm. The head appears slightly large in proportion to the body, with a prominent usnisa (topknot) atop the head. The face gives an impression of stiffness, as the area below the eyes is notably elongated compared to the upper part. The celestial garment (cheoni) diagonally crosses the broad chest, flows down the back, and drapes over both arms, with the right hand holding one of its strands. The skirt, folded once at the waist, cascades over the knees and extends to the ankles. The U-shaped, raised wrinkles on the skirt are rendered with sophisticated and elegant craftsmanship. While similar Bodhisattva statues from the Unified Silla period are commonly found, this piece shares typological affinities with works such as the Gyeongju Gamsansa Stone Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), created in 719 (18th year of King Seongdeok's reign), and the Gyeongju Gulbulsa Temple Stone Quadruple Buddha (Treasure), dated to the mid-8th century, despite differences in material.

The head halo contains lotus motifs, while intricate flame patterns adorn the outer edges of both sections. The pedestal beneath the figures bears double-lined lotus designs, a style reminiscent of Baekje-period works such as the Jeongjiwon-inscribed Gilt-bronze Standing Shakyamuni Buddha (Treasure) from Busosan Mountain and the Gilt-bronze Seated Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), though executed with greater refinement. The 'X'-shaped drapery, wing-like robe folds, and bent finger gesture reflect typical Three Kingdoms period iconography.

The main body (tapsin) alternates between door motifs and vividly sculpted Four Heavenly Kings, while the roof stone meticulously replicates wooden architecture with tile grooves, eave ends, and rafter patterns. Though the original finial is lost, a gold-plated bronze inscription (geumdong tapji) discovered during relocation confirmed its construction date to 844.  \n\nAs the oldest extant relic stupa in Korea, this masterpiece exemplifies refined elegance and craftsmanship, setting a precedent for subsequent stupa designs. Its historical and artistic significance lies in preserving the transition from abstract to representational Buddhist sculpture and its role in establishing Seon Buddhism's legacy.\"\n}",

Originating from King Jeongjo's personal diary, the Johnheongak Ilgi, which he began as a crown prince to reflect on his actions and studies—inspired by the Confucian Analects' teaching of daily self-examination—the records evolved into an official state diary.

      "content_en": "This is a Buncheong flat-sided bottle from the early Joseon period, measuring 22.5 cm in height, 5.2 cm in mouth diameter, and 8.6 cm in base diameter. The body is rounded with flattened sides and a small mouth. It features a grayish-brown clay body coated with white slip and a thick transparent light brown glaze. The shoulder below the mouth is adorned with a band of stylized lotus motifs, while the front flattened surface is decorated with lotus leaves, blossoms, and fish patterns. The sides display lotus motifs on the upper and middle sections, and a double lotus band at the lower part. The piece primarily employs the pajiki technique (scraping away slip to reveal the clay beneath), with additional harmonious line work for detailing. The striking contrast between the white slip and grayish-brown clay highlights the craftsmanship. Notably, the naturalistic depiction of lotus leaves and fish amidst multiple lotus buds on the front exemplifies the characteristic use of the pajiki technique, making it a representative work of this method.",

Widely circulated since the Three Kingdoms period, this manuscript is a 7-volume copy transcribed in silver ink during the 22nd year of King Gongmin's reign (1373) in the Goryeo Dynasty, based on the translation by Kumārajīva of the Later Qin. Each volume is accordion-folded for display, measuring 31.4 cm in height and 11.7 cm in width. Records at the end of the text indicate it was published through the patronage of Heo Chil-cheong, a senior official. Inscriptions on the reverse, such as 'Transmitted from Dogapsa Temple, Yeongam' or 'Transmitted by This Temple,' confirm its original ownership by Dogapsa Temple in Yeongam, Jeollanam-do. Though lacking illustrative diagrams (byeonsangdo), the manuscript is meticulously crafted and well-preserved. Its historical significance is further heightened by its recent repatriation from Japan, where it had been taken.",

The front of the headband features three tiers of continuous mountain-shaped patterns (산자형) at three locations, while the rear ends are adorned with two deer-antler motifs. Blue-green curved jades are attached: 16 on the mountain patterns, 9 on the deer-antler motifs, and 11 along the headband. Circular gold ornaments are symmetrically arranged to enhance the crown's opulence. The pendants, three on each side, are suspended from thick rings in decreasing lengths inward. The inner ends of the pendants bear blue-green curved jades matching the headband, while the outer ends feature leaf-shaped gold plates. The crown and its pendants were found disassembled. Notably, this crown stands out for its exceptional use of curved jades, surpassing others in grandeur and exemplifying the typical structure of Silla gold crowns.",

The presence of roof tile fragments and other artifacts at the site suggests it was part of a former temple. Although the statue has lost its pedestal and halo, it remains exceptionally well-preserved with nearly intact gilding. The face is elongated and round, conveying a plump appearance, while the neck is disproportionately long and thick. The body is unrealistically elongated compared to the head. The robe drapes over both shoulders, revealing the chest and abdomen with U-shaped folds. Three horizontal lines on the chest indicate an undergarment. The skirt's hem features overlapping, bold curved folds with unique softness and natural flow. Though the fingers are missing, the right hand is presumed to have been raised with the palm facing outward, while the left hand likely pointed downward with the palm exposed. The statue's cylindrical form and simplified U-shaped drapery reflect influences from the Chinese Sui Dynasty. Its discovery in the Han River basin, then under Silla control, supports its attribution to the Silla period.",

This work, *Sehando* (Winter Journey), measures 69.2 cm in width and 23 cm in height, and is considered his masterpiece. Painted in 1844 during his exile on Jeju Island, the artwork includes a personal inscription by Kim. In this text, he praises his disciple Yi Sang-jik, whose loyalty and virtue—compared to pine and juniper trees—inspired the painting as a gesture of gratitude for Yi’s efforts in procuring rare books from Beijing.\n\nThe composition centers on a solitary house flanked symmetrically by pine and juniper trees, with vast empty spaces emphasizing extreme restraint and simplicity. Above the right side, the title *Sehando* is accompanied by the phrases 'U-si-seong' (A Scholar’s Winter Thoughts) and 'Wandang' (Kim’s pen name), along with his seal. The rough, dry brushstrokes and stark ink tones evoke a desolate winter atmosphere, reflecting the artist’s inner resolve and integrity. This piece is celebrated as a quintessential late Joseon literati painting, embodying a rejection of superficial technique in favor of minimalism and moral depth.",

Its slender neck and flared trumpet-shaped base reflect Persian vessel influences. The neck features ten fine blue glass lines, a thicker line around the rim, and a handle with a bold blue glass attachment in an 'L' shape. Gold thread wrapped around the handle suggests it was repaired before burial.\n\nCup ①, also light green, has a wide top and narrow base. Its rim is surrounded by a hollow tubular band with a blue glass stripe, while the body displays blue wave patterns and raised lattice designs. Cup ②, light green with a wide rim, has a thickened edge and a slightly concave base. Cup ③, cylindrical and light green, has a wide rim with a tubular edge and faint blue accents at the top and bottom.\n\nThough severely damaged during excavation, the pieces were restored to reveal their original forms. The bottle and Cup ①, found in close proximity, likely formed a set. The glass quality, vessel shapes, and colors suggest they were imported from the Western Regions, offering evidence of cultural exchange between Silla and Central Asia during this period.",

The opening features a gold-illustrated 'byeongsangdo' (iconographic diagram) summarizing the sutra’s teachings, and a cover painting depicting guardian deities, buddhas, bodhisattvas, and floral motifs.

      "content_en": "The Bohyeobin Stone Pagoda derives its name from the enshrinement of the 'Bohyeobin Dharani Sutra' within it. Its unique form, unseen in traditional Korean pagodas, traces its origins to the Chinese Wu-Yue Kingdom. The last ruler of Wu-Yue, King Chongui (Chun Hongxu), was inspired by the legend of Indian Emperor Ashoka, who divided the Buddha's sacred relics into 84,000 stupas. Following this tradition, Chun Hongxu crafted 84,000 miniature pagodas from gold, bronze, and iron, each containing a copy of the 'Bohyeobin Dharani Sutra.' The only surviving stone version of such a pagoda in Korea is preserved at Dongguk University Museum. Originally found collapsed in a valley near Daepyeong-ri, Buk-myeon, Cheonan, the pagoda was relocated to its current site. The temple site, dated to the Goryeo period based on remaining stone foundations, pillar bases, and roof tiles, lacks historical records. The restored pagoda, incomplete with only five remaining stones, deviates from conventional Korean tower designs. It features two stacked square box-shaped stones topped with a decorative finial, a hexagonal base carved with Buddha images, a square platform, and another hexagonal tier engraved with four scenes from the Buddha's past lives. A circular sarira hole at the center of the top tier once held the sutra. The uppermost stone, resembling donkey ears, depicts episodes from the Buddha's life. Influenced by Chinese Bohyeobin pagodas, this Goryeo-era structure is a rare and invaluable artifact. In 2018, structural reinforcements were implemented using titanium plates to replace coin spacers, and a new base stone was added to enhance stability, based on humanities research and 3D scanning.",
