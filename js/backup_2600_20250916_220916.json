It consists of a body for burning incense and a lid sculpted in the form of a kneeling kirin, a mythical creature. The body flares outward at the top and is supported by three animal-shaped legs. Cloud patterns adorn the body and its rim, with the lid placed atop. The center of the lid features a kirin turning its head backward, its seat engraved with lightning patterns. The kirin's horn is broken, its mane rendered in curly details, and its eyes accented with black pigment dots. Structurally, incense smoke is designed to escape through the open mouth of the kirin. The burner is enveloped in a subtle, jade-green glaze characteristic of the period, exuding elegance. During the 12th century, when celadon glazes reached their zenith, such symbolic animal- and plant-shaped celadons were widely produced.",

Measuring 42.1 cm in height with a mouth diameter of 6.2 cm and base diameter of 17 cm, the vase features a small, low, slightly flared rim and broad, imposing shoulders. A floral band encircles the area below the rim, while a lotus pattern adorns the base. The central body displays intricate inlaid cloud and crane motifs: within black-and-white inlaid circular compartments, cranes ascend amid clouds, while outside these circles, cranes descend toward the lower section. This dynamic arrangement—alternating upward and downward crane movements—creates an illusion of spatial freedom beyond the vessel's physical constraints, reflecting Goryeo artisans' innovative approach to composition. The technical mastery and creative expression evident in the design underscore the sophistication and artistic ingenuity of Goryeo celadon craftsmanship.",

It comprises a body for burning incense and a lid shaped like a crouching lion. The body is supported by three animal-shaped legs adorned with finely carved cloud patterns on its surface, with additional cloud motifs arranged at three points along the upper rim. The lid depicts a lion seated on a pedestal decorated with floral patterns. The lion's posture, slightly shifted to the left, creates a dynamic visual effect. It is shown with its mouth open, one knee bent, and eyes rendered with black dots to represent pupils. Swirling patterns mimic the lion's mane at the back of its neck and hips, while its tail is raised and pressed against its back. The glaze exhibits a pale greenish-blue hue with a subtle, lustrous sheen. Structurally, the incense smoke from the body is designed to escape through the lion's open mouth, showcasing the refined craftsmanship of celadon incense burners from this period. During the early 12th century, when jade-green celadon reached its zenith, many symbolic celadon works modeled after auspicious animals and plants were produced. Notably, lion-shaped incense burners were particularly acclaimed by Song dynasty scholars for their exceptional artistry.",

Originally located on Bongdae Peak in Bukhansan, it was relocated to Gyeongbokgung Palace for preservation and is now housed in the National Museum of Korea. The stele is made of a rectangularly carved stone, erected on a two-tiered platform atop a natural rock base. The upper portion is partially missing, with the remaining body measuring 1.54 meters in height and 69 cm in width. The inscription consists of 12 lines, each containing 32 characters in regular script (haeseo), detailing the king's purpose for visiting the region and the reasons for erecting the stele. The text predominantly praises King Jinheung's territorial expansions. Although the exact date of construction remains uncertain due to eroded inscriptions, it is estimated to have been erected between 561 (the year of the Changnyeong Stele) and 568 (the year of the Hwangchoryeong Stele) during King Jinheung's reign. The stele was discovered and deciphered by scholar Kim Jeong-hui (Jeong-hee) in 1816, during the Joseon Dynasty, and remains a critical historical resource for studying the Three Kingdoms period.",

The body features raised scales and large pectoral fins carved in relief at the center. The handle, modeled after a lotus stem, curves naturally over the body, while the lid replicates a fish's tail fin. The jade-green glaze harmonizes with intricate incised patterns on the fins and floral motifs, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship.

Originally used in Buddhist rituals to symbolically cleanse evil, the water bottle was a vessel introduced to Korea via China from Western styles, but reached its most refined form during the Goryeo period. This masterpiece stands out among such artifacts with its serene jade-green glaze of a pale greenish-blue hue, adorned solely with white slip inlay depicting willows, reeds, lotus blossoms, and a pair of mandarin ducks arranged in a pictorial composition. The neck features a peony flower inlaid on each side. The spout, designed in an octagonal shape, is elegantly crafted and stands vertically atop the neck. The pouring mouth, round and modestly attached to one side of the shoulder, originally had a lid that is now lost. Early inlaid celadon pieces from this period are characterized by their meticulously refined glaze and clay body, with the jade-green glaze enhancing their sophistication. The addition of inlaid patterns further elevated their decorative appeal. This water bottle exemplifies the highly refined and elegant style of early Goryeo inlaid celadon craftsmanship.",

Published in 1448 (30th year of Sejong's reign), it comprises six volumes and six books in metal type.

Completed in September 1447, it was distributed to institutions like Sungkyunkwan by November 1448. Only Volumes 1 and 6 survive today. The main text uses woodblock characters, while smaller text and preface employ Gabinja type; the large characters are based on the handwriting of Grand Prince Jinyang. This work holds immense significance as Korea's first systematic documentation of Hanja pronunciation in its own phonetic system, rivaling Hunminjeongeum in linguistic value.

It serves as a crucial resource for studying both the stylistic characteristics of the enshrined Buddha and the architectural trends of the period. This particular shrine, standing 18cm tall, is crafted from bronze with a gilded surface. Inside, a square base surrounded by a railing supports the main Buddha triad—comprising the principal Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas—covered by a roofed structure resembling a Buddhist hall. The hall-shaped lid features large windows on the front and sides, allowing clear visibility of the enshrined statues. The principal Buddha has an abstract facial expression, with robes draped over both shoulders rendered in simplified linear folds. The mandorla (light halo) behind the Buddha is divided into a head halo and a body halo, adorned with flame patterns along the edges. The bodhisattvas on either side, except for their beaded crowns, share similar stylistic and technical features with the principal Buddha. The shrine remains in excellent condition, with its golden luster still vibrant and traces of green patina on the roof. Based on stylistic elements such as the elongated torso of the principal Buddha, irregular robe folds, and the beaded crowns of the bodhisattvas, it is estimated to have been created in the 11th–12th century under the influence of Northern Chinese traditions. This artifact holds significant value as a rare example illustrating wooden architectural styles and sculptural techniques from the Goryeo period or earlier.",

      "content_en": "This statue depicts a bodhisattva seated on a throne with the right leg crossed over the left, the right elbow resting on the knee, and the fingers of the right hand touching the cheek. Standing 80 cm tall, it was acquired by a Japanese individual in 1912 and donated to the Japanese Government-General of Korea. It was transferred to the Government-General Museum in 1916 and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The bodhisattva wears an elaborate crown with two strands of ornamentation cascading down to the shoulders. The square-shaped face, with prominent cheekbones and a recessed mouth, exudes a plump, serene smile. The upper body is robust and erect, while the lower body exhibits graceful curves. The hands and feet are disproportionately large compared to the slender limbs and physique. The overall form is elastic, smooth, and rhythmic, enhancing the statue's elegant aura. The celestial garment drapes over the shoulders, flares upward like bird feathers, flows down the chest, crosses at the left leg, wraps around the knees and arms. The skirt, slightly thick, features skillfully carved U-shaped folds. The elliptical lotus pedestal beneath the left foot is engraved with lotus patterns, though the halo at the back of the head is missing. Radiographic analysis in 1963 revealed no internal defects or repairs, with the material and craftsmanship noted as highly unusual. The balanced posture, beautiful drapery, and enigmatic meditative expression suggest it is a masterpiece of Korean Buddhist art, likely created in the mid-6th century or shortly thereafter.",

The robe drapes both shoulders, featuring a V-shaped fold at the front and feather-like trailing edges on either side. The right hand is raised with palm facing forward and fingers pointing upward, while the left hand, also palm-forward, has two fingers bent downward—a distinctive gesture.

Around the principal Buddha, the halo is divided into a circular head halo and rectangular body halo, intricately carved with lotus, vine, and grapevine motifs. The pedestal, a flared cylindrical base, is engraved with lotus designs. Stylistically similar to the National Treasure Gilt-bronze Sinmyo Buddha Triad, this statue follows the iconography of the Northern and Southern Dynasties of China.

Despite the dynasty's policy of promoting Confucianism and suppressing Buddhism, it remained a protected important temple until 1504, when King Yeonsan converted it into a brothel named Yeonbangwon (聯芳院), expelling the monks and leading to the temple's demise. This pagoda is the only one of its kind from the Joseon period, standing approximately 12 meters tall.

The pagoda's body comprises ten stories: the first three tiers retain the 'Asia' shape, while the upper seven form a square plan. Each story meticulously replicates wooden architectural elements, including roofs, bracketing systems (hyungja), and pillars. Unlike most Korean stone pagodas made of granite, this marble structure closely resembles the 10-story stone pagoda of Gyeongcheonsa Temple from the Goryeo period, drawing significant attention.

Both figures are mounted on short-legged horses atop thick rectangular bases. The horse's hindquarters feature a lamp with a hole, and a protruding spout on the chest allows water to be poured through the hollow body. The master figure wears a triangular hat adorned with a band and decorations, along with lattice-patterned trousers, reflecting elaborate horse trappings. The servant figure has a topknot wrapped in a headband, a bare upper body, a burden on its back, and holds a bell-like object in the right hand, suggesting a role as a guide. These ceramics provide critical insights into Silla-era spiritual beliefs, clothing, weaponry, horse gear, and artistic design.",

      "content_en": "This Buddhist statue, discovered in 1930 in Bongsan-ri, Hwacheon-myeon, Goksan-gun, Hwanghae-do, is currently housed at the Leeum Museum of Art. Standing 15.5 cm tall, it is a triad (three-bodied Buddha) carved on a single large halo (광배), with the central Buddha flanked by smaller bodhisattvas on either side. It is the largest extant statue of this format. The flanking bodhisattvas are significantly smaller, appearing almost dangling at the edges of the halo, which accentuates the prominence of the central Buddha. Apart from minor scratches on the Buddha's chest and the halo's right edge, the overall preservation is excellent.\n\nThe central Buddha has a plump face with a subtle smile, a large usnisa (육계, topknot), and thick robes covering the shoulders and extending to the ankles. The right hand is raised with the palm facing outward, while the left hand is lowered, palm downward. The halo, detachable from the statue, is fixed via a protruding spike on the back of the Buddha. Shaped like a boat (배 모양), the halo features a head halo and body halo around the Buddha, adorned with lotus, vine, and morning glory patterns. Flame motifs frame the edges, with small Buddha figures between the sections. The two attendant bodhisattvas at the halo's base have large faces and slender, cylindrical bodies, with X-shaped robe patterns on their chests. Their craftsmanship appears less refined compared to the central Buddha.\n\nAn inscription on the halo's reverse records that five individuals commissioned the statue to honor their teacher and parents. Stylistic and epigraphic analysis suggests it is a Goguryeo work, with the inscribed year 'Sinmyo' (辛卯) corresponding to 571 CE (13th year of King Pyeongwon's reign). While the statue's overall form—characterized by a large face, abstract body, and hand gestures—follows the style of the National Treasure Gilt-Bronze Standing Buddha from Yeonga 7th Year, it exhibits a softer, more refined aesthetic compared to the earlier piece's robust vigor.",

      "content_en": "This 20.7 cm tall gilt-bronze statue of a standing bodhisattva was discovered in 1967 in Samyang-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul, and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The statue exhibits a crack above the ankle and a partially detached left robe. The bodhisattva wears a triangular crown adorned with a small Buddha image and has a rounded, serene face with a faint smile. The narrow shoulders and protruding abdomen create a curved silhouette reminiscent of a bow when viewed from the side. Thick robes draped in a U-shape around the waist and knees obscure the leg contours, with simplified linear folds. The right hand holds a flask (vase), while the left hand extends upward with the thumb and index finger forming a straight V-shape—a distinctive gesture. The lotus pedestal features inverted petals with sharp tips, contrasting the statue's softness. Identified as Avalokiteshvara due to the triangular crown with a Buddha image and the flask, the statue's plump facial features, body proportions, and U-shaped drapery suggest a creation date in the early 7th century. It serves as a critical artifact illustrating the prevalence of Avalokiteshvara veneration during the late Three Kingdoms period.",

The square-like face lacks a smile, imparting a solemn expression. The thin robe clings closely to the body, subtly revealing bodily contours, though the garment's folds are not sharply defined. Bead decorations descending from the shoulders cross in an X-shape near the abdomen and extend down the legs, with a round floral medallion at the center—a motif influenced by ancient Chinese styles also seen in Three Kingdoms period gilt-bronze Buddhist statues. The right hand holds the robe's hem, while the left clasps a large water pot (jingbi), identifying the figure as Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. The hexagonal pedestal features an inverted lotus pattern at the base and an open lotus motif above, with broad, softly carved petals distinctive of Baekje craftsmanship. Despite extensive oxidation, the statue retains a vibrant golden hue and embodies the graceful elegance characteristic of Baekje Buddhist sculptures.",

Currently, the pedestal (daeza) on which the Bodhisattva once stood and the crown (gwan) it wore are missing, and the left hand has broken off at the forearm. The head appears slightly large in proportion to the body, with a prominent usnisa (topknot) atop the head. The face gives an impression of stiffness, as the area below the eyes is notably elongated compared to the upper part. The celestial garment (cheoni) diagonally crosses the broad chest, flows down the back, and drapes over both arms, with the right hand holding one of its strands. The skirt, folded once at the waist, cascades over the knees and extends to the ankles. The U-shaped, raised wrinkles on the skirt are rendered with sophisticated and elegant craftsmanship. While similar Bodhisattva statues from the Unified Silla period are commonly found, this piece shares typological affinities with works such as the Gyeongju Gamsansa Stone Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), created in 719 (18th year of King Seongdeok's reign), and the Gyeongju Gulbulsa Temple Stone Quadruple Buddha (Treasure), dated to the mid-8th century, despite differences in material.

The head halo contains lotus motifs, while intricate flame patterns adorn the outer edges of both sections. The pedestal beneath the figures bears double-lined lotus designs, a style reminiscent of Baekje-period works such as the Jeongjiwon-inscribed Gilt-bronze Standing Shakyamuni Buddha (Treasure) from Busosan Mountain and the Gilt-bronze Seated Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), though executed with greater refinement. The 'X'-shaped drapery, wing-like robe folds, and bent finger gesture reflect typical Three Kingdoms period iconography.

The main body (tapsin) alternates between door motifs and vividly sculpted Four Heavenly Kings, while the roof stone meticulously replicates wooden architecture with tile grooves, eave ends, and rafter patterns. Though the original finial is lost, a gold-plated bronze inscription (geumdong tapji) discovered during relocation confirmed its construction date to 844.  \n\nAs the oldest extant relic stupa in Korea, this masterpiece exemplifies refined elegance and craftsmanship, setting a precedent for subsequent stupa designs. Its historical and artistic significance lies in preserving the transition from abstract to representational Buddhist sculpture and its role in establishing Seon Buddhism's legacy.\"\n}",

Originating from King Jeongjo's personal diary, the Johnheongak Ilgi, which he began as a crown prince to reflect on his actions and studies—inspired by the Confucian Analects' teaching of daily self-examination—the records evolved into an official state diary.

      "content_en": "This is a Buncheong flat-sided bottle from the early Joseon period, measuring 22.5 cm in height, 5.2 cm in mouth diameter, and 8.6 cm in base diameter. The body is rounded with flattened sides and a small mouth. It features a grayish-brown clay body coated with white slip and a thick transparent light brown glaze. The shoulder below the mouth is adorned with a band of stylized lotus motifs, while the front flattened surface is decorated with lotus leaves, blossoms, and fish patterns. The sides display lotus motifs on the upper and middle sections, and a double lotus band at the lower part. The piece primarily employs the pajiki technique (scraping away slip to reveal the clay beneath), with additional harmonious line work for detailing. The striking contrast between the white slip and grayish-brown clay highlights the craftsmanship. Notably, the naturalistic depiction of lotus leaves and fish amidst multiple lotus buds on the front exemplifies the characteristic use of the pajiki technique, making it a representative work of this method.",

This work, *Sehando* (Winter Journey), measures 69.2 cm in width and 23 cm in height, and is considered his masterpiece. Painted in 1844 during his exile on Jeju Island, the artwork includes a personal inscription by Kim.

Above the right side, the title *Sehando* is accompanied by the phrases 'U-si-seong' (A Scholar’s Winter Thoughts) and 'Wandang' (Kim’s pen name), along with his seal.

Its unique form, unseen in traditional Korean pagodas, traces its origins to the Chinese Wu-Yue Kingdom. The last ruler of Wu-Yue, King Chongui (Chun Hongxu), was inspired by the legend of Indian Emperor Ashoka, who divided the Buddha's sacred relics into 84,000 stupas. Following this tradition, Chun Hongxu crafted 84,000 miniature pagodas from gold, bronze, and iron, each containing a copy of the 'Bohyeobin Dharani Sutra.' The only surviving stone version of such a pagoda in Korea is preserved at Dongguk University Museum. Originally found collapsed in a valley near Daepyeong-ri, Buk-myeon, Cheonan, the pagoda was relocated to its current site. The temple site, dated to the Goryeo period based on remaining stone foundations, pillar bases, and roof tiles, lacks historical records. The restored pagoda, incomplete with only five remaining stones, deviates from conventional Korean tower designs. It features two stacked square box-shaped stones topped with a decorative finial, a hexagonal base carved with Buddha images, a square platform, and another hexagonal tier engraved with four scenes from the Buddha's past lives. A circular sarira hole at the center of the top tier once held the sutra. The uppermost stone, resembling donkey ears, depicts episodes from the Buddha's life. Influenced by Chinese Bohyeobin pagodas, this Goryeo-era structure is a rare and invaluable artifact. In 2018, structural reinforcements were implemented using titanium plates to replace coin spacers, and a new base stone was added to enhance stability, based on humanities research and 3D scanning.",

Typically, Amitabha Triad paintings feature Avalokiteshvara and Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva as attendants, but this work uniquely substitutes Mahasthamaprapta with Ksitigarbha. Amitabha Buddha gazes downward at a person reborn in the Pure Land, radiating light. Ksitigarbha, positioned to the right, holds a bead in his right hand. Avalokiteshvara, standing before Amitabha with a slightly bent waist, holds a lotus pedestal on his palm.

Dated to the late Goryeo period, this work exhibits distinctive features, including the substitution of Ksitigarbha for Mahasthamaprapta, the placement of Avalokiteshvara in front of Amitabha, and the emphasis on illuminating the reborn soul.

It measures 29.2 cm in height, with a mouth diameter of 10.7 cm and a base diameter of 14 cm. The mouth flares outward, the shoulder swells before gradually narrowing downward, and the lid features a prominent lotus bud-shaped knob. The decoration includes faint underglaze blue patterns: a band of small, dense lotus motifs encircles the knob and its surroundings, with seven large dots placed around it. Horizontal lines with dots between them are drawn on the lid's sides. Simplified lotus bands adorn the shoulder and lower body of the jar. The central design depicts a plum tree trunk and bamboo branches rendered with nuanced shading. A distinctive feature is the bold simplification of patterns, emphasizing negative space to highlight the main motifs. Based on its form and decoration, it is presumed to have been produced at a state-managed kiln (gwanyo).",

Most known gilt-bronze towers measure 20–30 cm in height, with those exceeding 50 cm being exceptionally rare. However, this tower stands at 155 cm in its current state, indicating a notably large scale. Although only five stories of the tower body remain, it is believed to have originally comprised seven stories, with the loss of part of its finial suggesting it was even taller in antiquity.\n\nThe tower follows the general form of stone pagodas, featuring a two-tiered base, a five-story tower body, and a finial at the apex. The base is adorned with pillar motifs reminiscent of wooden architecture on its corners and surfaces. The lower tier’s surfaces bear lotus petals encircled by rounded bands, a characteristic feature of Goryeo-period stone pagoda styles.\n\nA railing encircles the base, supporting the tower body. The first story includes an entrance, pillars, and a roof, faithfully replicating wooden architectural techniques. While the second to fifth stories are carved with Buddhist images, the craftsmanship is relatively unrefined. Wind bells (풍탁) once hung from each roof corner, though many have been lost, leaving only a few remaining.\n\nDespite the near-complete loss of its original gold plating, the tower is exceptionally well-preserved. Its expansive base contrasts with the tower body’s light, soaring appearance. The profuse decorative elements and numerous ornaments underscore its nature as a craft pagoda, while its adherence to wooden architectural forms is evident throughout. Given its large scale, meticulous detailing, and metallurgical techniques, it is speculated to have been crafted in the early Goryeo period.",

Another identical painting exists, distinguished by its colored pigments and black-inked labels identifying buildings. Based on the presence and reconstruction dates of depicted structures, it is estimated to have been created by Dohwaseo (Royal Painting Academy) artists before 1830 (30th year of King Sunjo's reign). These paintings hold greater historical value for architectural research than artistic merit, offering a visually superior representation of palace layouts and landscapes compared to flat maps or the Donggwoldo diagrams.

The Mahayana Abhidharma-Samuchchaya is a text that compiles and elucidates the wisdom necessary for attaining Buddhahood. This volume, translated by Xuanzang during the Tang Dynasty, is part of the First Tripitaka Koreana created during the reign of King Hyeonjong of Goryeo (r. 1011–1031). Comprising 27 leaves, it was printed on thick, durable paper from woodblocks and designed to be unfolded like a folding screen. When folded, it measures 31 cm in height and 12.2 cm in width. In the Tripitaka catalog, which organizes texts according to the Cheonjagam (Thousand Character Classic) sequence, this volume is stored in the 'Bo' (寶) case. Leaf numbering uses the character 'jang' (丈) for leaves 1 to 26, with the final leaf marked as 'jang' (張), reflecting the common practice in the First Tripitaka. A distinctive feature is the omission of the final stroke in the 'gyeong' (竟) character at the end of the text, a hallmark of early Goryeo Tripitaka editions. The paper quality, carving technique, and ink tone confirm its 11th-century origin, and it remains in relatively good condition.",

A leading Neo-Confucianist and successor to the academic lineage of Yulgok Yi I, Song dedicated his life to studying Zhu Xi’s philosophy and was central to the Giho School. Renowned for his logical prose and calligraphy, his intellectual legacy remains influential.\n\nThe portrait, measuring 89.7 cm in height and 67.6 cm in width, is a half-length depiction on silk with polychrome pigments. Song is depicted wearing a black geon (hat) and a changui (scholar’s everyday robe), gazing to the right. His robust physique, exaggerated in scale, combined with distinctive eyebrows and deep wrinkles around the cheekbones, conveys a sense of scholarly depth. The face is lightly tinted with brown lines delineating wrinkles, while the robe’s folds are rendered with soft, simplified curves.\n\nInscriptions on the upper right include a 1651 self-commentary by Song in regular script (haeseo), and above center, a 1707 poem by King Sukjong honoring Jeong Mong-ju in clerical script (yeseo), accompanied by the notation 'Jeongmyo Year' (1707). However, uncertainties about the timing of these inscriptions complicate dating the artwork. While stylistic elements like simplified drapery and lack of shading suggest a 17th-century origin, some scholars argue it is an 18th-century copy, given the later inscription.\n\nAfter Song’s death, numerous shrines and academies were established nationwide to venerate him, leading to the production of many copies of his portrait. This version, regarded as one of the finest, epitomizes the aesthetic and symbolic traits of Joseon scholar portraits, reflecting both individuality and Confucian ideals.",

Each bell measures 14.4 cm and 14.3 cm in diameter, with the small bells (2.4 cm in diameter) featuring four oval holes. The main body has 2–3 lines of dotted patterns and a large '十' (sun symbol) motif.

The convex middle tapers toward the ends, which have bells with four oval holes and bronze beads inside. One bell has an additional small hole in the center.\n\n3. **Combined Ssangduryeong**: An X-shaped bell (17.3 cm long, 4.4 cm bell diameter, 628 g) formed by interlocking two bodies. One end has an insertion hole, while the other has a knob to secure the connection.\n\n4. **Ganduryeong (Cannonball-Shaped Bells)**: A pair (14.7 cm and 14.9 cm tall, 616.5 g and 571 g) divided into a body and handle with a brim. Hollow compartments hold bronze beads in the upper section, while the lower section is empty to amplify sound.

      "content_en": "The Great Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, often abbreviated as the 'Great Prajñā Sūtra' or 'Prajñā Sūtra,' is a foundational Mahayana Buddhist text centered on the concept of śūnyatā (emptiness), teaching that all phenomena lack inherent existence and thus should not be clung to. In Korea, it is widely known as the 'Heart Sutra' and is universally recited across Buddhist sects. This particular set comprises Volumes 162, 170, and 463 of the First Tripitaka Koreana, carved during the Goryeo Dynasty under King Hyeonjong (r. 1011–1031) to invoke Buddhist protection against Khitan invasions. Translated into Chinese by the Tang dynasty scholar Xuanzang, these volumes were printed on mulberry paper using woodblocks and designed as scrolls. Volume 162’s colophon reveals it was commissioned in 1046 by Heo Jinsu to pray for the king’s peace, his mother’s longevity, and his deceased father’s spiritual welfare. Distinct from the later Haeinsa Tripitaka Koreana (Second Tripitaka), the First Edition exhibits differences such as varying character counts (25 lines × 14 characters per line vs. 23 × 14), absence of publication dates, use of pi-hui (avoidance of imperial names) and abbreviated characters, and the use of '장(丈)' or '폭(幅)' instead of '장(張)' for page numbering. These three volumes, preserved in similar condition, are critical for dating other First Tripitaka prints due to Volume 162’s explicit historical record.",

      "content_en": "This set of four white porcelain bowls was created in the early Joseon period. Each bowl measures approximately 11.1 cm in height, 21.1 cm in rim diameter, and 7.9 cm in base diameter. The rims exhibit a bold, outward-flaring form. The pieces are devoid of decorative patterns, with a well-melted glaze that imparts a bright white hue. Inside the base of each bowl, the glaze was scratched to inscribe the characters 'Cheon' (天), 'Ji' (地), 'Hyeon' (玄), and 'Hwang' (黃). These inscriptions are believed to correspond to the names of royal storage houses—Cheonjago, Jijago, Hyeonjago, and Hwangjago—located near Geunjeongjeon Hall in Gyeongbokgung Palace, where royal tableware was stored and categorized. The refined clay, evenly applied glaze, pure white color, neat footring, and fine sand supports suggest these were high-quality wares produced at state-operated kilns in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, for royal use. As early Joseon white porcelain, this set serves as critical material for tracing the historical lineage of Korean white porcelain craftsmanship.",

The front and back panels depict chrysanthemums and orchids rendered in raised relief, accompanied by bees and butterflies. The orchids are in cobalt blue, chrysanthemums in copper-red, stems and leaves in iron-black, and insects in iron-black or copper-red.

Additionally, land and official positions were bestowed upon their parents, spouses, and descendants. These details, absent from the Joseon Annals, were revealed through this document. The text employs Idumun (吏讀文), a mix of Chinese characters and Korean phonetic elements, making it a valuable historical and linguistic resource. Printed using woodtype (목활자), it is one of the most complete early Joseon woodblock-printed documents surviving in South Korea. Its rolled format reflects early Joseon characteristics, though the uneven letter sizing and irregular arrangement indicate less refined printing techniques. As a rare extant example of early Korean woodtype printing, it holds significant importance in the history of Korean typography.",

It synthesizes medical knowledge from Joseon and Chinese sources with clinical experiences. Although King Seonjo initially commissioned its compilation in 1596 with Heo Jun, Yang Yesu (楊禮壽), and Lee Myeong-won (李命源), the project was halted by war. Heo Jun independently completed it after 14 years of dedication. The Dongui Bogam is widely acclaimed as the most outstanding medical work authored by Koreans, both domestically and internationally. The first edition, printed in 1613 using wooden movable type by the Royal Secretariat (Nauiwon), consists of 25 volumes and 25 books.\n\nThe text is organized into five main sections: a 2-volume table of contents, the Naegyeong Pyeon (內景篇, Internal Medicine) with 4 volumes and 26 subsections, the Oehyeong Pyeon (外形篇, External Medicine) with 4 volumes and 26 subsections, the Japbyeong Pyeon (雜病篇, Miscellaneous Diseases) with 11 volumes and 38 subsections, the Tangyeok Pyeon (湯液篇, Decoctions and Medicinals) with 3 volumes and 17 subsections, and the Chimgu Pyeon (鍼灸篇, Acupuncture and Moxibustion) with 1 volume and 1 subsection. Each section systematically categorizes diseases, detailing theories, prescriptions, and source references.\n\nThe Dongui Bogam was widely disseminated beyond Joseon, influencing medical practices in China and Japan. In China, it was published multiple times starting in 1763 (Qianlong 28), while in Japan, the first edition appeared in 1724 (Kyoto Shorin) and was reprinted in 1799 (Osaka Shorin), solidifying its status as a essential text in East Asian medicine.\n\nThe Kyujanggak Institute of Seoul National University houses two copies. The Taebaeksan Sagobon (太白山史庫本), a 24-volume set, lacks Volume 16 of the Japbyeong Pyeon. However, a separate 17-volume set from the same woodblock edition includes the missing volume, complementing the Taebaeksan copy. Designated in 2008, the Dongui Bogam’s historical significance as the first edition and its completeness—achieved through the supplementary volume—were pivotal in its recognition as a national treasure.",

The site is believed to have been a temple from the Three Kingdoms period, as evidenced by numerous roof tile and pottery fragments found in the area.\n\nThe Bodhisattva stands gracefully on a lotus-adorned pedestal, with a slightly bent right knee, exuding natural elegance. The crown, decorated with floral motifs, features a small Buddha image at its center. The rounded face, with distinct eyes, nose, and mouth, bears a serene smile.\n\nThe slender, well-proportioned body is clad in thin, clinging robes. The garment drapes over the right arm, forming a circular fold at the knee before cascading over the left arm to the pedestal. A necklace with bead decorations extends from the shoulders in an X-pattern, mirrored on the statue's back. The right hand gently holds a lotus bud, while the left hand, though missing its original object, suggests it once grasped an offering. The seven-sided pedestal is engraved with downward-facing lotus petals.\n\nCurrently, parts of the crown, robe drapes, and left hand fingers are damaged, and the halo is lost. Rust is present on the face and right hand, but the gilding remains relatively intact. This statue exemplifies the typical style of mid-7th century Silla gilt-bronze Bodhisattva sculptures, showcasing exceptional balance and craftsmanship.",

Its overall shape closely resembles the modern outline of the Korean Peninsula, extending northward to Manchuria and southward to Jeju Island and Tsushima Island, reflecting Joseon's territorial consciousness during the period. Dated to approximately 1557–1558 (12th–13th years of King Myeongjong's reign), the map was taken to Japan during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and preserved in Tsushima before being acquired in the 1930s.

Originally named 'Seoru' (West Pavilion), it was renamed 'Jukseoru' (Bamboo-West Pavilion) in the late 14th century. Historical records, including Kim Su-on's *Jukseoru Dancheonggi* (1472) and Heo Mok's *Jukseoru Gi* (1662), indicate that Governor Kim Hyo-son (1373–1429) rebuilt the pavilion on its original site in 1403. Although it underwent multiple repairs and expansions after its reconstruction in the early Joseon period, its original form from the late Joseon era has been well preserved. The name 'Jukseoru' is derived from its location west of Jukjangsa Temple, as noted by Heo Mok.\n\nThe pavilion was initially a five-kan (front) by two-kan (side) structure rebuilt in 1403. It was expanded to three-kan on the south side in 1530 and two-kan on the north side in 1788, resulting in its current hipped-and-gabled (paljak) roof form. The central five-kan section from the early Joseon period and the later additions on the left and right exhibit distinct architectural features in column arrangements, structural framing, ceiling treatments, bracket systems, and decorative details.\n\nThirteen of the 22 pillars stand directly on natural bedrock, while nine are supported by stone foundations. The southern expansion retains exposed natural rock flooring, with only the central kan paved for accessibility. The interior features an open layout without walls or partitions, with exposed rafters (yeondeung ceiling) and grid-patterned (ungmul) ceilings. The floor is constructed with a grid-style wooden plank (ungmul maru) system, flanked by railings to prevent falls.\n\nThe pavilion once housed numerous plaques inscribed with poems by King Sukjong, King Jeongjo, and prominent literati, though many were lost during the 1959 Typhoon Sarah. Twenty-eight plaques remain, including the 1710 inscriptions 'Jukseoru' and 'Gwandong Jeilru' (First Pavilion of Gwandong) by Governor Lee Seong-jo. Literary works such as Jeong Cheol's *Gwandong Byeolgok* and paintings by Jeong Seon (*Gwandong Myeongseungcheop*, 1676–1759), Kim Hong-do (1745–1806+), and Kang Se-hwang (1713–1791) further attest to its cultural significance.\n\nSamcheok Jukseoru holds immense historical value due to well-documented construction and expansion dates, architectural evolution across eras, and its association with literary and artistic legacies.

The pagoda follows the typical Unified Silla style, featuring a three-tiered body atop a two-tiered base. The lower base is adorned with celestial beings (天人像) in flowing garments, while the upper base depicts the Eight Legions of Divine Beings (八部神衆) seated on clouds, brandishing weapons in a majestic posture. Each tier's body and roof stones are carved from single blocks, with the first-tier body stone featuring various Buddhist images. The roof stones have slightly uplifted eaves at the corners, enhancing their graceful beauty, and are supported by five-tiered bases. Only the finial base remains atop the third-tier roof stone, as the original ornamental elements have been lost. Balanced in composition, this pagoda is one of the representative stone pagodas of the Unified Silla period. The exquisite carvings on the base and the sophisticated Buddhist images on the first-tier body stone evoke the former splendor of Jinjeonsa Temple.",

The Palsangjeon Hall is the only remaining five-story wooden pagoda in Korea. The current structure was rebuilt after the Imjin War (1592-1598) and underwent dismantling and restoration in 1968. Its name derives from the 'Eight Scenes of the Buddha's Life' (Pal Sang-do), which are painted on the walls, depicting eight key moments from the Buddha's life.\n\nThe architectural design varies by floor: the first and second floors have five bays (front and side), the third and fourth have three bays, and the fifth has two bays. Stone staircases on all four sides and a low foundation contribute to its stability despite its height. The roof features a pyramidal (samo) style with a finial atop. Structurally, the first to fourth floors use the jusimpo bracket system (supports placed only above columns), while the fifth floor employs the dapo bracket system (supports between columns as well).\n\nInternally, the hall houses a space for enshrining sarira relics, Buddha statues, the Eight Scenes paintings, and an area for worship. As the tallest surviving tower and the sole wooden pagoda in Korea, the Palsangjeon Hall holds immense historical and architectural significance.",

The upper pillars exhibit a creative design reminiscent of the stone railings at Bulguksa Temple's Dabotap Pagoda, preserving an archaic aesthetic. The lower railing wall is further embellished with intricate patterns, enhancing its ornate beauty.

During a 1917 restoration, relics and a Goryeo-era mirror were discovered in the sixth-story body and base, suggesting a secondary enshrinement during the Goryeo period. Though grand in scale, the pagoda appears less stable due to its height-to-width ratio, with some scholars attributing this to alterations made during Japanese colonial-era repairs, which may have compromised its original structural integrity and detailing.",

It is the oldest and most uniquely shaped stone structure carved with lions. Resting on an octagonal base, two lions face each other, pressing their chests together and standing on the lower stone with their hind legs, while supporting the upper stone with their front paws and muzzles. Lotus patterns are engraved on both the lower and upper stones, with the double-layered lotus design on the upper stone exuding an antique charm.

The octagonal fire chamber (hwasaseok) is tall with four openings to allow light to emanate. The roof stone, horizontal at the eaves but slightly uplifted at the eight corners, appears modest and stable due to its unadorned simplicity. Dated to 720 CE (19th year of King Seongdeok's reign), the lantern's proportions—though the roof stone appears slightly large—create a harmonious balance with the broad base, radiating a dignified grandeur. Unlike typical Unified Silla stone lanterns that used octagonal pillars, this innovative design substitutes them with twin lions, a pioneering approach that inspired later imitations.

Erected after Silla occupied the Goguryeo territory of Jeokseong, it was intended to stabilize the local populace. Discovered in 1978, the stele was found buried underground in a tilted state, with its inscription remarkably well-preserved. The stele is wide and thick at the top, narrowing and thinning toward the bottom. Though the upper portion is missing, both sides remain nearly intact, suggesting it was crafted from a natural stone with a freeform shape. The total number of characters is estimated at around 440, with 288 legible characters remaining today. The calligraphy aligns precisely with horizontal and vertical lines in each row, showcasing a rhythmic brushwork style transitioning from clerical script (Lishu) to regular script (Kaishu), making it a valuable resource for calligraphic studies. The inscription commends the people of Jeokseong who aided Silla's territorial expansion and pledged loyalty, while promising equal rewards to future loyalists. This reveals new insights into the development of Silla's legal system (Yulryeong), particularly regarding penal and administrative laws. It highlights that national laws on labor systems and property distribution were established early in King Jinheung's reign, with local customs of Jeokseong generalized into legal statutes. By comparing the ranks of ten high officials mentioned in the inscription with records from the Samguk Sagi, the stele is dated to between the 6th and 11th years of King Jinheung's reign (545–550 CE). Its placement in Jeokseong, a strategic stronghold for northern expeditions, reflects Silla's intent to affirm control over new territory and integrate subjugated Goguryeo populations. Though not a pure memorial stele (erected to commemorate a king's inspection tour), it holds significant value as a territorial expansion stele, embodying the spirit of such monuments.",

      "content_en": "This book is a handwritten diary composed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin (1545–1598) during the Imjin War (1592–1598), consisting of seven volumes organized by year. Yi Sun-sin failed the military selection exam (Hunlwon Byeol-gwa) at age 28 due to a horse accident but passed the civil service exam four years later, beginning his career as a government official. Renowned for his exceptional loyalty, literary talent, and poetic skills, he prepared for Japanese invasion as Commander of the Jeolla Left Naval District by constructing warships and strengthening military defenses in Yeosu. During the Imjin War, he achieved decisive victories at battles such as Okpo, Sacheon (where the Geobukseon turtle ship debuted), Danghangpo, and Hansan. In the Japanese re-invasion (Jeongyu Jaeran), he triumphed at Myeongnyang. Posthumously honored as a First-Class Meritorious Subject of Martial Valor in 1604, he was posthumously promoted to Prime Minister and granted the posthumous title 'Chungmu' (忠武). His unwavering loyalty, moral integrity, and leadership saved the nation from crisis, leaving an indelible legacy in Korean history.\n\nThe diary's structure includes: Volume 1 (Imjin Ilgi, 27 pages, May 1, 1592–March 1593), Volume 2 (Gyesha Ilgi, 30 pages, May–September 1593), Volume 3 (Gapo Ilgi, 52 pages, January–July 1594), Volume 4 (Byeongsin Ilgi, 41 pages, January–October 1596), Volume 5 (Jeongyu Ilgi, 27 pages, April–October 1597), Volume 6 (Jeongyu Ilgi Sok, 20 pages with partial overlap, August 1597–January 1598), and Volume 7 (Musun Ilgi, 8 pages, September–October 1598). Written intermittently during seven years of war, it was preserved by descendants for over 390 years. As the original draft of the diary included in Chungmu Gong Jeonseo, it contains detailed military strategies, naval control records, and drafts of battle reports, offering invaluable insights into Joseon's military system and wartime operations.",

      "content_en": "Enshrined in the Upper Daeungjeon Hall (Treasure) of Janggeosa Temple, located on Mount Chilgap in Cheongyang County, Chungcheongnam-do, this iron Buddha statue sits majestically on a massive square stone pedestal. The statue is backed by a wooden halo, replacing the original stone halo which was lost. The Buddha's usnisa (topknot) is modestly rendered, and the face exhibits a round, refined appearance. Though the body is robust and dignified, the lack of volumetric fullness and reduced elastic proportions suggest it was crafted in the late 9th century. The right hand touches the ground in a gesture of earth witness, while the left hand, originally holding a medicine vase (now missing), rests on the lap. The monastic robe, loosely draped over the left shoulder, features sparse and scattered folds.\n\nThe four-sided pedestal, far more grandiose than the statue itself, comprises three tiers: a broad, tall base; a relatively low and small middle tier; and an upper tier. The base stone is exceptionally wide, with traces of pillars at each corner, indicating the presence of an enclosed shrine space. The lower tier is adorned with inverted lotus patterns and large floral carvings at the corners. The middle tier features prominent eye-shaped motifs (ansang), while the upper tier displays blooming lotus patterns.\n\nThe wooden halo, likely a Joseon-era replacement for the original stone version, incorporates floral designs at the center and flame patterns around the edges, reflecting stylistic influences from the late Silla to early Goryeo periods. This statue is acclaimed as an outstanding example of early 10th-century Buddhist art, inheriting the late 9th-century style through its unique pedestal resembling a pagoda, niche-like structure, and elegant iron-casting technique.",

The reliquary measures 74 cm in height and 50 cm in width and length, featuring a circular top and a flat, tunnel-shaped base. The inner chamber, carved to a depth of approximately 45 cm, includes ledges suggesting the installation of a sarira apparatus and a door. Inscribed on both sides of the chamber are 10 characters each in a clerical script (隸書) style from China's Northern and Southern Dynasties. The epigraph reveals that the reliquary was created in 567 by King Chang (r. 554–598, also known as King Wideok), son of King Seong, to honor the sarira offered by a princess—daughter of King Seong and sister of King Chang. This artifact serves as a critical epigraphic resource for Baekje history, illustrating cultural exchanges between Baekje and China. Additionally, it is historically significant as the first confirmed case where the founding date of a Baekje temple is verified through contemporary artifacts, clarifying the chronology of Buddhist practices in the kingdom.",

The statue features a tall cylindrical crown atop neatly combed hair and holds a bronze lotus flower in both hands. Its broad, distinct facial features and unconventional, overwhelming scale exemplify a uniquely Korean aesthetic sensibility, diverging sharply from the refined idealism of Unified Silla sculpture.

These tablets, discovered alongside the tomb in 1971, serve as 'maejigwon' (land deed inscriptions) addressed to the earth deity, formalizing the acquisition of the tomb site. The king's stele measures 41.5 cm in width and 35 cm in height, with an inscription divided into six lines within a 5–6 cm border. Its text aligns with records from the Samguk Sagi. The reverse side features a square grid marking the 12 compass directions, though the western section is notably absent. The queen's stele, identical in size, bears a 4-line inscription within a 2.5–2.8 cm border, with the remaining 13 lines left blank. Its reverse side contains the land purchase text (maejimun). Originally created for King Muryeong's burial, the reverse was later reused to inscribe the queen's epitaph upon her interment. As the sole surviving 'maejigwon' from the Three Kingdoms period, these steles are invaluable for identifying tomb occupants and understanding Baekje burial practices.

      "content_en": "Designated as a Treasure in 1963, this Gilt-bronze Seated Bhaisajyaguru Buddha from Janggeosa Temple in Cheongyang gained further historical significance following the discovery of its votive inscription and enshrined relics. The inscription specifies the exact production date as 1346 (2nd year of King Chungmok's reign in Goryeo), establishing it as an absolute benchmark for studying late Goryeo Buddhist statues. The statue exemplifies the iconography of Bhaisajyaguru (Medicine Buddha) with a distinct medicine bowl mudra, while its head, facial features, and bodily proportions reflect the quintessential stylistic traits of 14th-century Buddhist sculpture. Notably, it showcases exceptional artistic craftsmanship and technical mastery, with minimal casting flaws both internally and externally. Unlike most late Goryeo statues linked to Amitabha Pure Land devotion, this is the only surviving gilt-bronze Bhaisajyaguru statue from the period, offering critical insights into both Amitabha and Bhaisajyaguru faith traditions. The enshrined relics include a votive text listing 1,116 patrons—the largest recorded in late Goryeo—providing invaluable data for reconstructing historical narratives due to the scarcity of contemporary documents. Among the patrons is Baegun Kyŏnghan (1298–1374), a key figure in the Goryeo Buddhist triad (alongside Naong Hyegeun and Taego Bou), whose previously obscure activities are now illuminated through this inscription. The patrons, including royal figures and lower-ranking military officials, likely commissioned the statue to pray for longevity and the salvation of relatives lost in Mongol invasions. Mongolian names like Bayan Temür (King Gongmin's Mongol name) and others in the list also attest to the cultural influence of the Yuan dynasty in 14th-century Korea. Accompanied by silk fragments with donor inscriptions, a high-quality incense pouch, and the votive text, this statue holds profound value not only in art history but also in Buddhist studies and social history, vividly capturing the era's religious, artistic, and socio-political landscape. These attributes collectively affirm its eligibility for national treasure status.",

The pagoda stands on a high terrace northwest of the temple, surrounded by pine forests, facing the stone lantern. It features a three-story tower body atop a two-tiered base. The lower base is adorned with protruding carvings of celestial beings (cheonin) playing musical instruments, holding flowers, and dancing in praise. The upper base, the most notable section, is supported by four lions—two male and two female—at each corner, all gazing forward with open mouths revealing sharp teeth. At the center, encircled by the lions, stands a monk in a praying posture, believed to represent Monk Yeon Gi's mother. Directly ahead, a kneeling monk statue faces the stone lantern, symbolizing Yeon Gi's profound filial piety as he offers tea to his mother while bearing the lantern.

At the center sits Amitabha Buddha, flanked by Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva on the left and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva on the right. Above the scene, six arhats are arranged in pairs on either side against a cloudy backdrop, with two small buddhas painted above them. The composition mirrors the enshrined Amitabha Triad statue in front. The central Buddha is seated cross-legged on a high lotus pedestal, draped in robes covering both shoulders, with a key-shaped halo behind. Avalokiteshvara, with flowing hair and a translucent outer robe, stands to the left, while Ksitigarbha on the right holds a monk’s staff in his right hand and a wish-fulfilling jewel in his left. The palette primarily uses green and red hues. Created in 1476 (7th year of King Seongjong’s reign) by the painter-monk Haeryeon, the mural retains Goryeo-era characteristics such as soft coloration and naturalistic body forms. Simultaneously, it exhibits early Joseon features like simplified patterns and figures proportionate to the main Buddha, making it a critical resource for studying the transition between Goryeo and early Joseon Buddhist art.",

The composition exemplifies a well-structured symmetry, with both upper and lower sections mirroring each other. The lower portion centers on the First Assembly, the 'Bodhi Field Assembly,' flanked by the 7th, 2nd, and 8th assemblies on the left and the 9th 'Seodarim Assembly' on the right. The upper section ascends from the 3rd 'Trayastrimsa Heaven Assembly' and 4th 'Yama Heaven Assembly' on the right to the 5th 'Tusita Heaven Assembly' and 6th 'Tahojai Heaven Assembly' on the left, maintaining balanced symmetry. The use of ochre, red, green, and gold on a mineral-pigmented silk ground, along with high-relief ornamentation on the jeweled adornments of the Buddha figures, reflects the vibrant aesthetic trends of 18th-century Buddhist painting. Notably, the lower register includes the 'Illustration of the Lotus Realm,' which visualizes the 39th chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra, where Samantabhadra Bodhisattva explains the pure land of Vairocana Buddha. Historical records indicate the painting was created in 1770 (46th year of King Yeongjo's reign) by 12 monk-artists led by Hwaryeon at Ansimsa Temple on Mount Mudeung, later relocated to Songgwangsa. As the earliest extant Joseon-era Avatamsaka Sutra illustration, it holds significant scholarly value for its meticulous and effective depiction of the sutra's doctrinal content.",

It holds historical significance as the central naval base that contributed to the victories in the Imjin and Jeongyu Wars, and retains its original form from its renovation in 1718 (44th year of King Sukjong's reign) by Naval Commander Lee Je-myeon. With a scale of 15 kan (bays) in width, 5 kan in depth, and a total area of 240 pyeong, it is the largest surviving local government building in Korea.\n\nThe structure's plan consists of 68 pillars. The inner pillars at the second bay on both eastern and western sides were relocated forward, treated as high pillars (goju) that directly support the main beam (jongbo). Cross beams (daeryang) are joined to these high pillars with bracket systems (pojak), and eave beams (tuibo) are placed above. Between the inner and outer pillars on the front and rear, simple eave brackets (tuiryang) are installed, while two cross beams (chungryang) on the side bays extend inward, their ends adorned with dragon-head carvings (yongdu) resting on the cross beams.\n\nThe pillars exhibit the min-heulrim tapering technique. Externally, the bracket system follows a multi-tiered (dapogui) style with two-tiered brackets (chumok) and decorative lotus-bud motifs, while internally it adopts a simpler ikong-style bracket system using overlapping wooden blocks (salmi). The front central pillars feature dragon-head brackets (yongmeori ikchogong). Each bay is accentuated with a floral bracket (hwanban), enhancing the façade's spatial composition. Original dancheong (traditional multicolored paintwork) patterns remain well-preserved on both interior and exterior elements.\n\nTo maximize interior space, the high pillars on both sides were set backward, optimizing functionality while maintaining structural integrity. The use of robust yet minimalist materials contributes to the building's grandeur. Additionally, two cross beams on the side façades ensure stability, reflecting advanced 18th-century architectural techniques. Despite its early 18th-century reconstruction, Yeosu Jinnamgwan exemplifies exceptional historical, academic, and artistic value.",

The set comprises one Yeongsanhoesangdo (Assembly on Vulture Peak Painting) and eight Pal Sangdo (Eight Scenes of the Buddha’s Life). Notably, the inscription on the Yeongsanhoesangdo uses the term 'Pal Sanghoe' (Eight Scenes Painting) instead of 'Hwabuldo' (Back Buddha Painting), emphasizing that this Yeongsanhoesangdo was produced as the central image alongside the Pal Sangdo series.\n\nThe Pal Sangdo depict eight pivotal events in the life of Sakyamuni Buddha. While the concept of the Eight Scenes was shared across Buddhist cultures, their thematic composition and iconography varied by region. In Korea, the specific sequence of the Eight Scenes—① Tosalraeuisang (Descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven), ② Biramgangsaengsang (Birth in Lumbini Garden), ③ Samunyugwangsang (Observing Suffering at the Four Gates), ④ Yuseongchulgasang (Leaving Home), ⑤ Seolsansudosang (Ascetic Practice in the Snow Mountains), ⑥ Suha Hangmasang (Subduing Mara under the Bodhi Tree), ⑦ Nokwonjeonbopsang (First Sermon in Deer Park), and ⑧ Ssangrimyeolbansang (Parinirvana in the Twin Groves)—was formally established in the early Joseon period, as illustrated in the iconic depictions of the *Worin Seokbo* (Moonlight Reflection on the Buddha’s Biography).\n\nDuring the late Joseon period, a new style of Pal Sangdo emerged, influenced by the *Seokssi Wonryu Eungwasajeok* (Chronicle of the Buddha’s Lineage and Manifestations). The Songgwangsa Pal Sangdo exemplifies this shift, with inscriptions confirming their creation in 1725 (1st year of King Yeongjo’s reign) under the lead painter Uigyeom (義謙).\n\nHoused in the Songgwangsa Seongbo Museum, this ensemble is the earliest known complete set of Yeongsanhoesangdo and Pal Sangdo enshrined together in a single hall. It reflects Joseon’s unique approach to visualizing the Buddha’s life through Buddhist art. Significantly, both the Yeongsanhoesangdo and Pal Sangdo employ iconography from the *Seokssi Wonryu Eungwasajeok*, forming a cohesive conceptual and artistic whole. This work not only highlights the diversity of late Joseon Yeongsanhoesangdo but also establishes a new paradigm for Pal Sangdo.

Created in 1635 (13th year of King Injo's reign) during the late Joseon period, these statues represent a collaborative masterpiece by renowned sculptors Cheongheon (also known as Cheongheon), Ungwon, In-gyun, and their disciples. They stand as a quintessential example of 17th-century Buddhist sculpture. The 'Trijang Buddha' refers to the three bodies of Buddha: Dharmakaya (Vairocana), Sambhogakaya (Rohmani), and Nirmanakaya (Sakyamuni), a iconography rooted in Hwaeom (Huayan) Buddhist thought. While commonly depicted in paintings or sutra illustrations, these statues are the only surviving sculptural representation of the Trijang Buddha, making them an indispensable case study in the history of post-Imjin War Buddhist ideology and sculpture. Recent discoveries of relic documents and inscriptions have clarified the production timeline (1634–1635), patrons, and participants. Commissioned during the temple's post-war reconstruction (1630–1636), the project was overseen by Monk Byeokam Gakseong (1575–1660), an influential figure who led the restoration of major temples devastated by the Imjin War. Notable patrons included Prince Uichang Lee Hwang (1589–1645), King Seonjo's eighth son, his spouse, Sin Ik-sung (1588–1644), King Seonjo's son-in-law, and 1,320 donors, including 580 monks. The statues, seated on elaborate lotus pedestals and octagonal wooden thrones, exceed 3 meters in height. Their monumental scale and robust, simplified lines reflect the sculptors' mastery. The Vairocana and Sakyamuni statues, with stern expressions, are attributed to Cheongheon's school, while the Rohmani statue, characterized by softer facial features and rounded eyelids, is linked to Ungwon and In-gyun. As the largest 17th-century wooden Buddhist statues and the sole sculptural Trijang Buddha ensemble, these works hold unparalleled significance in Buddhist art history, showcasing exceptional artistic and technical achievement.",

According to the Samguk Yusa (三國遺事), Kim Daeseong built Seokguram Grotto to honor his past-life parents and Bulguksa to honor his present-life parents. However, he did not live to see its completion, and the state later finished the temple, designating it as a site for national prayers. \n\nThe Dabotap Pagoda and Sakyamuni Pagoda (Three-story Stone Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple, National Treasure) are Korea's most representative stone pagodas, with similar heights of 10.29m and 10.75m, respectively. They face each other between Daeungjeon Hall and Jahamun Gate, with Dabotap located to the east. Dabotap represents a unique pagoda style, while Sakyamuni Pagoda exemplifies the conventional Korean stone pagoda form. Their symmetrical placement symbolizes the Lotus Sutra's narrative, where Prabhutaratna Buddha (the Buddha of the past) attests to the teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha (the Buddha of the present). \n\nUnlike Sakyamuni Pagoda, which clearly has a three-tier structure on a two-tiered base, Dabotap's layers are difficult to discern. Its cross-shaped base features stone staircases on all four sides, an octagonal tower body, and a square railing. Constructed around 751, the pagoda ingeniously integrates square, octagonal, and circular elements without appearing cluttered, reflecting the essence of 8th-century Unified Silla artistry. The uniform proportions of its components—length, width, and thickness—highlight its meticulous design. \n\nTragically, Dabotap bears the scars of Japanese colonial rule. Around 1925, Japanese authorities dismantled and restored the pagoda without documenting the process, resulting in the loss of relics, sarira, and related artifacts originally housed within. Additionally, three of the four stone lions that once guarded the base's staircases were looted during this period.

The robust two-tiered base is designed to bear the pagoda's weight, with carved pillar motifs at each corner mimicking wooden architecture. Similar pillars adorn the tower body, and the upturned corners of the roof stones impart a dynamic, soaring aesthetic.\n\nIn September 1966, the pagoda was damaged by tomb raiders.

Originally named Seokbulsa, it stands as a masterpiece of Silla Buddhist art. King Gyeongdeok (r. 742–765) presided over a golden age of Buddhist culture, during which other iconic heritage sites like Bulguksa Temple, Dabotap Pagoda, Three-story Stone Pagoda, and Hwangnyongsa Bell were also created.\n\nCarved into the slopes of Tohamsan Mountain using white granite, the grotto features an artificial stone chamber. The structure comprises a rectangular antechamber (jeonsil) connected by a corridor to a circular main chamber (jushil), with the latter's dome crafted from 360 interlocking stone slabs—a globally unparalleled architectural feat. Though originally housing 40 statues, only 38 remain today.\n\nThe antechamber displays eight guardian deities (four on each side), while the corridor entrance features Vajra guardians and the Four Heavenly Kings. The main chamber, supported by octagonal pillars, enshrines the principal Buddha (Shakyamuni) slightly rearward of the center. Its walls depict two celestial beings, two bodhisattvas, ten arhats, and the intricately carved Eleven-Headed Kwanum Bodhisattva behind the main statue.\n\nRenowned for its mature sculptural techniques and lifelike expressions, Seokguram's artworks—including the serene main Buddha, the ornate Eleven-Headed Kwanum, dynamic Vajra guardians, imposing Heavenly Kings, graceful bodhisattvas, and individualistic arhats—are considered pinnacles of East Asian Buddhist sculpture. The grotto's harmonious integration of architecture, mathematics, religion, and art earned it National Treasure status and UNESCO World Heritage designation (jointly with Bulguksa) in 1995. Due to preservation concerns, public viewing through glass barriers has been implemented since 1976.",

The cylindrical section is constructed with 27 layers of fan-shaped stones, featuring a smoothly finished exterior and a rough interior with protruding stone roots.

The cross-shaped top platform has long interlocking stones protruding outward. Similar structural features are found at the 19th–20th and 25th–26th layers, likely used to support ladders for ascent. Historical records indicate observers climbed through the window using external ladders and internal steps to reach the top for celestial observations. Astronomy was closely tied to agriculture, as celestial patterns dictated farming schedules, and to politics, as astrology (占星術) was used to predict national fortune.

The title 'Jingbi' signifies 'to discipline in advance and be wary of future calamities.' Yu Seong-ryong, a disciple of Toegye Yi Hwang and a contemporary of Kim Seong-il, passed the civil service examination in 1566. He held key positions, including Minister of Personnel, Minister of War, and Chief State Councilor, and played a pivotal role in recommending generals Gwon Yul and Yi Sun-sin. He also advocated for military reforms, such as weapon production, fortress construction, and naval strengthening. Renowned for his scholarly and calligraphic achievements, he was posthumously honored with the title 'Munchung' and enshrined at Byeongsan Seowon in Andong.\n\nWritten during Yu's retirement, Jingbirok provides a meticulous account of pre-war Japan-Joseon relations, Ming Dynasty's military aid, and naval strategies. The manuscript was first published in 1647 (16 volumes, 7 books) under the supervision of Jo Su-yuk, then reprinted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1695. Its historical value led to a royal ban on its export to Japan in 1712. Alongside Nanjung Ilgi (Yi Sun-sin's war diary), Jingbirok remains an indispensable primary source for studying the Imjin War.",

Found within the pagoda's sarira chamber were an outer sarira case, silver inner and outer sarira containers shaped like spheres, a gilt-bronze sarira case, the Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong (The Great Dharani Sutra on Unceasing Light), various beads, and other artifacts. Surrounding the sarira case were bronze flying celestial figures, a complete and a quartered bronze mirror, wooden pagodas, jade beads, glass beads, and incense wood. At the base of the sarira case, a bundle of paper wrapped in silk was found, though the text was illegible due to deterioration.\n\nThe outer sarira case features symmetrical vine patterns pierced on all four sides, with similar designs on its base. The roof is adorned with vine motifs and lotus decorations at the apex, corners, and ridges, while leaf-shaped ornaments hang from the eaves. This 8th-century masterpiece showcases intricate openwork and inlaid jewels. The silver inner and outer containers, gilded and egg-shaped, display lavish lotus patterns and fish-roe motifs (eozamun) characteristic of mid-8th-century craftsmanship.\n\nThe gilt-bronze square sarira case bears line-engraved depictions of a pagoda flanked by bodhisattvas on its front and back, and guardian kings (Inwang) on its sides. Its lid features a three-tiered pagoda finial, and inside rests a small sarira bottle carved from sandalwood.\n\nThe Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong, printed on a scroll approximately 8 cm wide and 620 cm long with 8–9 characters per line, is recognized as the world's oldest extant woodblock-printed text, dating to the mid-8th century. Severely damaged upon discovery, it underwent full restoration between 1988 and 1989. The sutra is linked to the 751 CE reconstruction of Bulguksa Temple, with characters used exclusively during Empress Wu Zetian's reign (690–705 CE) aiding in its chronological attribution.",

Each pagoda features a three-tiered tower body (tapseong) atop a two-tiered base (gidan), sharing identical scale and style. This twin-pagoda arrangement marks the earliest known example of a dual-tower temple layout (sangtapgaram) in Silla, emerging shortly after the unification of the Three Kingdoms. \n\nGamunsa Temple was commissioned by King Munmu, who unified the Three Kingdoms, to establish national prestige and harness Buddhist power to repel Japanese pirates frequently attacking the eastern coast. The temple was constructed near the East Sea, though King Munmu did not live to see its completion. His son, King Sinmun, fulfilled his father's vision, completing the temple in 682 CE, the second year of his reign. Reflecting this patriotic Buddhist ideology, the pagodas were designed to embody grandeur, solemnity, and vigor. \n\nA distinctive feature of these pagodas is their construction from multiple assembled stone blocks, diverging from earlier monolithic designs. The West Pagoda yielded significant artifacts during its 1960 restoration: a gilded bronze sarira reliquary (Treasure) and its outer case (Treasure). As the tallest three-story stone pagodas in Gyeongju, they stand firmly on an elevated site overlooking the East Sea, symbolizing Korea's architectural mastery and serving as iconic representations of traditional Korean stone pagodas.",

Volume 3, missing its first six pages, contains 50 pages; Volume 4 has 31 pages; and Volume 5, lacking its final four pages, comprises 26 pages, totaling 107 pages. Notable instances of pi-hwi (avoidance of using certain characters out of respect for royal names) include substituting 'Yong (豊)' for 'Yong (隆, the name of Taejo's father)' and omitting a stroke from 'Mu (武, the name of King Hyejong)'. However, most pi-hwi conventions are absent, indicating this is a Joseon-era publication from the early 15th century. Compared to the widely referenced 1512 Jeongdeok edition printed in Gyeongju, this copy exhibits significant textual differences. As the earliest extant version of the Samguk Yusa, dated to the late 14th century (early Joseon period), it holds immense value for bibliographic studies and serves as a critical resource for correcting errors in the later Jeongdeok edition.",

The temple was destroyed during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and rebuilt in 1945. In the 1990s, numerous relics were found inside the wooden Buddha statue enshrined in the main hall. Historical records discovered with the statue confirmed it was crafted in 1458 (4th year of King Sejo’s reign) as the principal Buddha of a triad at Beopcheonsa Temple. The statue exhibits early Joseon Buddhist sculpture characteristics, such as the ushnisha (topknot) on the crown and drapery folds around the arms and abdomen. However, the exact location of Beopcheonsa Temple remains unclear, as the name appears in multiple regions across Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, and Jeolla provinces. Among the relics found inside the statue were a 'Buddha Statue Production Record' detailing its creation and list of donors, a 'Collected Buddhist Scriptures (Budojo Samgyeong Hapbu)', Buddhist talismans, and 14 items across seven categories. Additionally, 38 types of textiles, five incenses, five grains, and seven treasures (glass, amber, pearls, etc.) matching descriptions in the 1824 'Ancestral Ritual Text' (Josanggyeong) published by Ujeomsa Temple were uncovered. These relics not only date the statue to the early Joseon period but also serve as vital resources for bibliographic and textile studies due to their individual historical and artistic value.",

The stele's scale, tortoise pedestal, and dragon-topped capstone exemplify the typical style and craftsmanship of the late Unified Silla period. The inscription divides Silla's Buddhist history into three eras and meticulously records Master Jijeung's doctrinal lineage: Dosin → Beoprang → Sinhaeng → Junbeom → Hye-eun → Dohyeon. This makes the stele a critical primary source for studying late Silla Buddhist history, particularly the development of Seon (Zen) Buddhism. Composed by the eminent scholar and literary figure Choe Chi-won, it is celebrated as one of the 'Four Mountain Stele Inscriptions' alongside the Stele of Daeungyeongsa Temple, the National Treasure Stele of Nanghye Temple Site in Boryeong, and the National Treasure Stele of Sanggye Temple in Hadong. Its scholarly value has long been recognized. The stele also specifies its erection date and identifies Hye-gang, a monk from Bunhwangsa Temple, as the calligrapher, offering vital insights into Korean paleography. Unlike other biographical records, Choe Chi-won structures Master Jijeung's life into 'Six Divine Events' (육이) and 'Six Virtuous Deeds' (육시), a unique narrative feature absent in other epitaphs. Additionally, the inscription provides extensive data on late Silla's personal names, place names, official titles, temple names, systems, and customs, serving as a key resource for Silla historiography. Notably, it documents the royal land ideology (왕토사상), procedures for donating land to temples, and clarifies how Seon school establishments relied on local elites' patronage—details explicitly recorded here. It is the sole Silla-era stele detailing temple administrative roles (사직). Furthermore, it contains the only domestic record of Baekje's Sotdo (sacred groves). In summary, this stele holds immense value not only as a biographical record of Master Jijeung but also as a pivotal artifact for research on Korean ancient history, Silla Seon Buddhism, paleography, and literary history.",

This version was published during the reign of King Gojong of Goryeo (1237–1248). Known as the Goryeo Daejanggyeong due to its production period, it is also called the Palman Daejanggyeong (80,000 Wooden Printing Blocks) because it contains approximately 80,000 panels and 84,000 Buddhist teachings corresponding to the 84,000 human sufferings.\n\nThe creation of this Tripitaka was motivated by the destruction of the initial version (Ch'obo Daejanggyeong) during the Mongol invasion of 1232. The Goryeo government established a temporary agency, the Daejanggeom, to produce a new set, aiming to repel the Mongol forces through Buddhist spiritual power. The carving was overseen by the Branch Daejanggeom in Namhae, South Gyeongsang Province.\n\nOriginally stored at Daejanggyeong Pan-dang outside the west gate of Ganghwa Island, the blocks were later moved to Haedongseong and then to Haeinsa Temple in April 1398 (7th year of King Taejo of Joseon), where they remain today. Currently housed in Haeinsa’s Dharani Pavilion and Sudarajang, the collection comprises 81,258 panels according to a Japanese colonial-era survey, including some recarved during the Joseon period. Each panel measures approximately 70 cm in width, 24 cm in height, and 2.6–4 cm in thickness, weighing 3–4 kg.\n\nThe Tripitaka consists of 1,496 texts across 6,568 volumes. Its notable feature is the meticulous correction of errors by Sugi Daesa, a monk from Gaetaesa Temple, who referenced the Northern Song edition, Khitan version, and the initial Goryeo Tripitaka during production.\n\nAs the sole surviving record of the lost Northern Song and Khitan Tripitakas, these blocks are invaluable for their historical and scholarly significance. With no typographical or omissions errors across millions of characters, they represent unparalleled precision and completeness. Recognized for their historical depth and perfection, the Haeinsa Daejanggyeong Wooden Printing Blocks were inscribed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 2007.",

The region was incorporated into Silla in 555 (16th year of King Jinheung's reign) and later merged with Dayaju (present-day Hapcheon County) in 565, becoming known as Bisabalgun or Bijahwa-gun. The stele, originally located at the foot of Mokmasanseong Fortress, was relocated to its current site in 1924 and housed within a protective pavilion. Carved onto a flattened natural stone with a bordered frame, it differs from other 'pure steles' (commemorating royal inspections) by lacking the title '순수관경 (Peripatetic Governance),' hence its designation as a '척경비 (territorial annexation stele).'

The rounded junction between the mouth and body, along with a shallow rim on the base's edge, enhances stability. The near 1:1 ratio of height to width demonstrates balanced proportions. On the broad mouth's upper surface, six evenly spaced circles contain Sanskrit characters (beomja) in silver inlay, interspersed with cloud motifs.

This makes it the oldest surviving hyangwan in Korea, serving as a critical chronological reference for studying Goryeo-era incense burners.

The statue was enshrined alongside the Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong (無垢淨光大陀羅尼經, Sutra of the Pure Light Great Dharani) at Gwaneumam Hermitage of Seoknamamsu Temple (石南巖藪, an ancient temple site). As the oldest extant Vairocana Buddha in Korea with the jinin (智拳印, wisdom fist gesture), it holds paramount importance in the study of ancient Buddhist sculpture, particularly given the scarcity of dated materials from this period. The establishment of the jinin mudra in a Tathagata (如來形) form by 766 CE reflects evolving Buddhist thought and historical trends, marking a pivotal moment in East Asian Buddhist art. This statue is recognized as the earliest inscribed Vairocana Buddha with the jinin mudra in East Asia, offering invaluable iconographic and stylistic insights for Buddhist art history. Additionally, the inclusion of the Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong within the statue's enshrinement provides critical evidence of early practices in Korean Buddhist statue consecration rituals.",

Measuring 1,022.3×635 cm overall and 943×619 cm in the painted area, the scroll centers on Shakyamuni Buddha flanked by Manjusri and Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas. The Buddha, occupying the composition’s core, has a round, serene face and a dignified posture, with heavy robes draped over both shoulders. The chest features a prominent swastika symbol, while the red and green robes are adorned with vibrant floral patterns. The bodhisattvas, slightly smaller than the Buddha, hold lotus branches and wear elaborate headdresses. Their round faces, frontal stances, and recessed positioning behind the Buddha create a sense of depth. Rich hues of blue, sky-blue, and pink, combined with intricate floral motifs and jewelry, enhance their grandeur. Above the Buddha, figures of his disciples Ananda and Mahakasyapa, along with other buddhas, are depicted. Created in 1722 (2nd year of King Gyeongjong’s reign) by the monk painter Uigyeom (義謙) and collaborators, this gwaebul is celebrated for its dynamic composition, robust figures, luminous colors, and floral decorations, representing a masterpiece of early 18th-century Buddhist art. It is particularly noted for its triad of Shakyamuni, Manjusri, and Samantabhadra, drawing comparisons to the gwaebul of Yecheon Yongmunsa Temple, and remains a vital resource for Buddhist painting studies.",

The temple's name, 'Tongdosa' (通度寺), signifies 'attaining enlightenment through the Geungangkdae Altar' and guiding beings to paradise. The current structure was rebuilt in 1645 (23rd year of King Injo's reign in the Joseon Dynasty) after being destroyed during the Imjin War (1592–1598).\n\nThe Daewongjeon measures 3 kan (front) by 5 kan (side) with a unique T-shaped roof. Its multi-bracket (dapo) system supports the eaves, featuring decorative brackets both above columns and between them. The exterior base and stone staircases retain exquisite lotus carvings from the Unified Silla period. The Geungangkdae Altar, a sacred site for Buddhist ordination ceremonies, symbolizes the Buddha's perpetual presence. The current altar, repaired multiple times during the Goryeo and Joseon periods, follows Korea's traditional design, with a bell-shaped stone reliquary at its center. The inner side of the first-tier base depicts celestial beings, while the outer side features carvings of Indra, the guardian of Buddhist law.\n\nAs a mid-Joseon architectural exemplar with a confirmed construction date, the Daewongjeon is vital for architectural and historical studies. Together with the Geungangkdae Altar, which holds profound religious significance, they are esteemed as pivotal cultural heritage assets reflecting Korea's spiritual and artistic legacy.",

This statue is judged to have been created in the late 9th century, contemporaneous with the Wooden Seated Vairocana Buddha in Beopbojeon Hall, based on similarities in size and craftsmanship, a conclusion supported by scientific analysis. As the oldest surviving wooden Buddha statue in Korea, it holds immense historical and academic value. The enshrined relics date from the Goryeo to early Joseon periods, reflecting the temple's founding in 802 CE and indicating that the statue was crafted shortly after Haeinsa's establishment, undergoing multiple gilding and repairs. These relics, created under royal patronage, include rare texts and fabrics, serving as a representative example of early Joseon royal Buddhist votive objects. The statue features a dignified, balanced physique, a monk's robe draped over one shoulder and under the other arm, natural and elastic fabric folds, and the dharmachakra mudra (left index finger clasped by the right hand). Notably, it is carved from incense cedar, a rare material in Korean wooden statues, which are typically made of pine or ginkgo. Only three Korean statues, including this one and another at Haeinsa's Beopbojeon Hall, as well as a Goryeo-era wooden Avalokiteshvara statue at Bonggwangsa Temple in Andong, are known to use incense cedar. The statue's construction technique—using a single cylindrical log for the body with separately attached head and arms, and tightly curled hair made with clay and attached densely—exemplifies early joinery methods from the Goryeo period. This statue, embodying 9th-century stylistic traits, has remained a central object of worship at Haeinsa since its creation. Its significance lies in its status as a rare 9th-century relic at Haeinsa and as a symbol of the temple's Huayan Buddhist ideology. The enshrined relics, spanning Goryeo to early Joseon, provide critical insights into the statue's repair history, Buddhist practices, Haeinsa's royal connections, and relic enshrinement methods, affirming their exceptional academic value.

      "content_en": "The National Treasure 'Dry Lacquer Seated Portrait of Monk Hee-rang at Haeinsa Temple, Hapcheon' is a sculptural depiction of Monk Hee-rang (希朗大師, 10th century), a prominent Buddhist monk active during the late Silla to early Goryeo periods. As the only surviving portrait sculpture (祖師像; monk portrait) from Korea, it is estimated to have been created in the early 10th century during the Goryeo Dynasty. While numerous portrait sculptures of eminent monks were produced in contemporary China and Japan, such works are exceedingly rare in Korea, making this piece the sole extant example that realistically recreates the likeness of a historical religious figure. Monk Hee-rang, a scholar deeply versed in Hwaeom (華嚴) Buddhism, is said to have resided at Hee-rang-dae (希朗臺) within Haeinsa Temple, devoting himself to ascetic practice. He is also recognized as the mentor of King Taejo Wang Geon (王建), the founder of Goryeo, and played a pivotal role in the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms. Historical records from the Joseon Dynasty confirm that the sculpture was enshrined at Haeinsa Temple for centuries, moving through halls such as Haengdang (解行堂), Jinsangjeon (眞常殿), Josajeon (祖師殿), and Bojangjeon (寶藏殿). Accounts from late Joseon scholars, including Yi Deok-mu's (李德懋, 1741–1793) 'Gayasan-gi' (伽倻山記), further authenticate its provenance. The sculpture combines dry lacquer (乾漆) for the front—face, chest, hands, and knees—with wooden components for the back and base, showcasing advanced technical methods of the period. This hybrid technique is also observed in earlier Buddhist sculptures, such as the Treasure-designated 'Dry Lacquer Seated Bhaisajyaguru Buddha at Cheongnyangsa Temple, Bonghwa.' Unlike later Joseon-era monk portraits, which often adopt idealized forms, this piece stands out for its lifelike realism: a slender, life-sized physique, benevolent gaze, faint smile, and visible skeletal structure beneath aged skin evoke a vivid, almost living presence. A small hole in the chest, symbolizing his epithet 'Hyungyeol Gukin' (胸穴國人; 'Nation’s Chest-Hole'), is linked to a legend where Hee-rang allowed mosquitoes to draw blood from his chest to aid others' meditation. However, such chest holes often symbolize spiritual power, as seen in the 1024 Treasure-designated 'Portrait of Seungga Monk at Seunggasa Temple, Bukhansan.' The sculpture’s historical significance lies in its dual role as both a rare surviving example of early Goryeo portrait sculpture and a testament to Hee-rang’s contributions to Buddhist scholarship and national unification. Its artistic excellence, technical innovation, and embodiment of the monk’s spiritual essence render it a culturally invaluable artifact, warranting its designation as a National Treasure to ensure preservation and public recognition.",

      "content_en": "Yeongnamnu Pavilion traces its origins to a small pavilion called Geumbyeoknu, Soru, or Juknu, which was part of Yeongnamsa Temple established during the Unified Silla period. After the temple was abandoned in the Goryeo dynasty, the pavilion remained, and in 1365 (14th year of King Gongmin’s reign), it was rebuilt and renamed Yeongnamnu by Kim Ju, the magistrate of Miryang, marking the beginning of its role as an official pavilion. The Goryeo scholar Jeong Jisang (d. 1135) composed the classical Chinese poem 'Yeongnamsaru,' depicting the pavilion’s night view. During the early Joseon period, An Jil (d. 1447), the magistrate of Miryang, expanded the complex by adding a smaller pavilion to the west. In 1442, this structure was named Soru by Gwon Gi and later renamed Imgyeongdang (now Chimryugak) by Lee Chung-geol (1465–1527). In the same year, Kim Yeong-chu, another magistrate, built Manghodang as a guesthouse on the northeast side of Yeongnamnu. In 1542, Park Se-hu relocated Manghodang to the east of the main pavilion, renaming it Neungpakak, and Imgyeongdang became Chimryugak. By the mid-16th century, Yeongnamnu evolved into a complex centered on the main pavilion (Daeru) flanked by Chimryugak and Neungpakak. This layout is depicted in Lee Kyung-hong’s 16th-century painting 'Miryang Sibjigdo.' The complex was destroyed during the Imjin War (1592–1598) but underwent multiple reconstructions. In 1844, under magistrate Lee In-jae, the main pavilion was expanded, and Yeosu-gak (a connecting structure) was added, finalizing the current configuration. The entire area, including Yeongnamnu, was called Miryanggwan and served as a guesthouse for officials and visitors. The main pavilion (Daeru) is a large wooden structure with a 5×4 bay rectangular plan, 7-bay framework, hipped-and-gabled roof with extended eaves, and roof-end tiles. It features an open interior with a well-floor and railings on all sides. Neungpakak (3×2 bays, 5-bay framework) and Chimryugak (3×2 bays, 5-bay framework) are connected to Daeru via Yeosu-gak. The harmonious arrangement of these four buildings on sloped terrain showcases exceptional architectural aesthetics and integration with the surrounding landscape. Yeongnamnu’s scenic beauty inspired numerous literary works, with over 300 poems once displayed on its walls; 12 plaques remain today. Prominent calligraphic plaques include 'Yeongnamnu' by Jo Yun-hyeong (1725–1799), 'Gangjwa Ungbu' by Lee Yu-won (1814–1888), and 'Gyonomyongnu' by the same artist. Yeongnamnu holds significant historical value as it has retained its location since the 16th century, supported by extensive historical records.

The hall measures five bays wide and four bays deep, featuring a hipped-and-gabled (paljak) roof. Low walls along the sides and rear reflect Chinese architectural techniques. Facing Dae Seongjeon are Dongmu (East Shrine) and Seomu (West Shrine), erected in 1603–1604 (36th–37th years of King Seonjo), which house tablets of Confucius’s disciples and Chinese and Korean sages. Walls connecting Dongmu and Seomu demarcate the ritual and educational zones.\n\nMyeongnyundang, constructed in 1606 (39th year of King Seonjo), serves as the educational hall. Its central auditorium (jungdang) has a gabled (matchbet) roof, while the flanking wings (iksil) feature lower paljak roofs, symbolizing hierarchical order. The balanced roof lines and proportions exemplify traditional Korean architectural aesthetics. Dongjae and Seojae, long dormitory buildings facing Myeongnyundang, were used as student residences.\n\nSeoul Munmyo and Sungkyunkwan historically functioned as the center for Confucian rituals and education during the Joseon Dynasty.

Donhwamun is the oldest surviving wooden structure among palace main gates, constructed in May 1412 and renovated in 1609 (the first year of King Gwanghae's reign). Originally, the gate lacked a signboard, but during King Seongjong's reign, the scholar Seo Geo-jeong was commissioned to name it, after which the signboard was installed. The second-story gatehouse features bells and drums used to announce specific times: at noon (ogo), a drum was beaten; for the curfew (injeong), the bell was struck 28 times; and for the lifting of the curfew (paru), it was struck 33 times. Donhwamun is a south-facing structure with five bays on the front and two on the sides, featuring a three-door configuration with the side bays walled off. The central gate served as the royal entrance, while the left and right gates were used by high-ranking officials.

Simhui, who entered monastic life at age nine, founded Bongrimsa Temple in Changwon after years of ascetic practice.

He later delivered sermons to King Gyeongmyeong at court before returning to Bongrimsa to mentor disciples until his death at 68.

The tortoise's oversized head clutches a wish-fulfilling jewel, with remnants of horn sockets on its crown. Intricate cloud patterns surround the square socket on its back, designed to hold the stele. The body stone, partially restored using historical rubbings, bears the inscription composed by King Gyeongmyeong, with calligraphy by Hanggi (행기) and carving by Seonghyu (성휴).

While the exact origin and acquisition history are unknown, it is said to have been obtained from a Japanese individual during the colonial period. Traces of gilding remain across the surface, with patches of green patina. The head is adorned with small spiral-shaped hair curls, and a prominent usnisa (symbolic topknot) is present near the crown, though it is low in height. The face is square-shaped, with elongated eyes slanting sideways, a small nose and mouth, and plump, fleshy cheeks. This rounded yet flat facial appearance reflects the stylistic characteristics of Unified Silla period Buddhist statues. The broad robes draped over both shoulders flow downward, forming a U-shaped collar and enveloping the body. The chest features a depiction of an inner garment and a belt knot, a hallmark of Unified Silla Buddhist iconography. The right hand is raised with the palm facing outward, while the left hand extends downward, also displaying the palm—a gesture common in Buddhist symbolism. The back of the statue has large hollows at the top and bottom of the body, a technical feature associated with the casting methods of Unified Silla gilt-bronze buddhas. Overall, the statue exhibits a stocky, rounded physique with a disproportionately large head.

One of the pair was taken to Japan but was repatriated to South Korea in 1966 under the 1965 Korea-Japan Agreement, and is now housed in the National Museum of Korea. Dating to the 5th–6th century Silla period, the earrings feature a typical three-part structure: a main ring (jugori), a middle ornament, and a finishing decoration. The main ring, which hooks to the ear, is thick and robust, while the middle section is adorned with a slender, leaf-shaped pendant. The lowest part terminates in a heart-shaped leaf motif. The central ring is meticulously finished with thin gold plates at both ends, and the elongated leaf-shaped middle ornament is decorated with engraved linear patterns along its edges and center, enhancing its luxurious appearance. The heart-shaped leaf at the base is further embellished with double rows of engraved lines along its border and central vein, creating a striking three-dimensional effect and opulent aesthetic. This artifact holds significant value as a representative example of the Gyeongju-style tagwanisik (ring-shaped earrings), distinguished by its superior craftsmanship, excellent state of preservation, and its role in illustrating the stylistic evolution of Silla goldwork, influencing later designs such as those found in the Geumjo Chong and Bomun-dong Tombs.",

      "content_en": "The 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - Perseverance (安重根義士遺墨-忍耐)' is one of the calligraphic works collectively designated as cultural heritage. These pieces were created by Ahn Jung-geun (1879–1910) while he was imprisoned in Lushun Prison from February to March 1910, following his assassination of Ito Hirobumi, the architect of Japanese aggression against Korea, at Harbin Station on October 26, 1909. Ahn was executed on March 26, 1910. The works bear inscriptions on the left side reading 'Written in the Second (Third) Month of the Year Gyeongsul (1910), at Lushun Prison, by Ahn Jung-geun, a Citizen of the Korean Empire (庚戌二(三)月, 於旅順獄中, 大韓國人安重根書),' accompanied by a handprint seal (掌印).\n\nThe content of the calligraphy includes didactic passages from classical texts like the Analects (論語) and Records of the Grand Historian (史記), personal reflections, critiques of societal change, warnings to Japan, and inscriptions of others' study names (堂號). Most of these works were gifted to Japanese individuals involved in his imprisonment, such as prosecutors and guards. Notably, 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - If One Seeks Glory for East Asia, One Must First Reform State Policies; Delay Leads to Regret (安重根義士遺墨-欲報東洋先改政略時過失機追悔何及)' was received by Orida Tadashi (折田督), a former Russian-Japanese War correspondent who later worked at Lushun Prison. It was passed to his nephew, Orida Kanji (折田幹二), during the family's return to Japan after Korea's liberation in 1945 and donated to Dankook University on February 20, 1989. Another piece, 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - Loyalty in Words, Faithfulness in Action; Universal Virtue (安重根義士遺墨-言忠信行篤敬雖蠻貊亦足以有別乎)', was gifted by the grandson of a prison officer, Yagi Masazumi (八木正澄), to the Ahn Jung-geun Memorial Society in October 2002. Additionally, 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - National Security: Constant Anxiety (安重根義士遺墨-國家安危勞心焦思)' and 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - Devotion to Country: The Soldier's Duty (安重根義士遺墨-爲國獻身軍人本分)' were inscribed as gifts for Prosecutor Yasuoka.",

Depicting him seated on a chair facing right, the painting portrays Kang Hyeon wearing an official hat and green ceremonial robes, seated on a chair adorned with a tiger skin. As the father of the literati artist Kang Se-hwang, Kang Hyeon held prominent positions such as Daijehak (Grand State Councilor) and Minister of Rites. The facial depiction employs fine lines to render shading around the eyes, nose, chin, and cheeks, effectively capturing the reddish complexion characteristic of an elderly figure. The clothing wrinkles are minimally rendered with unshaded lines, emphasizing the subject's dignified presence. This work exemplifies the conventional format and artistic techniques of 18th-century Joseon portraits, particularly through elements like the tiger skin on the chair.",

Created as preliminary sketches, the works demonstrate dynamic and elegant brushwork, capturing the figures with meticulous detail. Faces are rendered with delicate fine lines, while clothing incorporates a balanced use of thin and thick strokes.

The robe is crafted on a plain white silk ground, with intricate embroidery using techniques such as chain stitch (자련수), flat stitch (평수), and running stitch (선수), along with yellow and vermilion silk threads. Dated to the early 18th century, the kasaya bears an unidentified name on its reverse, though the individual's lifespan remains unverified. Among the approximately ten surviving kasayas from this period, this piece is uniquely distinguished as the only one entirely adorned with embroidered illustrations.",

The barrel is divided into six segments, with the three segments near the breech spaced narrower than those near the muzzle to prevent bursting from explosive force. The fluted design (양각) allows it to double as a club during close combat. The handle bears incised inscriptions (음각) detailing the manufacturing year, weight, and the artisan’s name, though the original wooden handle has deteriorated over time. According to the inscription, it was crafted in 1579 (12th year of King Seonjo’s reign) by Kim Ji, who served as the Jeolla Left Naval Commander and Gyeongsang Army Commander. As an early example of the Seungja Chongtong, this firearm holds significant historical value in the study of Korean arms manufacturing, demonstrating the development of portable firearms during the Joseon Dynasty.",

Large square holes on both shoulders suggest the presence of a wooden structure in front of the rock-carved Buddha. The statue features a prominent usnisa (topknot) on its bald head and a gentle yet dignified facial expression. The upper body is robust with broad shoulders, and a U-shaped chest reveals knots from the inner and outer robes. The clothing, draped over both shoulders, is rendered thicker than the body, showcasing a novel stylistic feature. The left arm is intricately carved with dense wave-like folds under the armpit, while the right arm has broader folds, creating a harmonious structural balance. In contrast, the lower body appears less stable. The right hand extends straight fingers to lightly grasp the robe, while the left hand is bent at the abdomen but holds no object. The mandorla (halo) is divided into head and body sections by two raised lines, with the body halo deeply engraved along the body's contour in a single line. Despite its simplified form and somewhat rudimentary details, the statue's rounded facial features and balanced proportions make it a representative rock-carved Buddha from the early Goryeo period.",

By the 12th century, Goryeo had established itself for over 200 years, with aristocratic culture at its zenith and a harmonious blend of Confucianism and Buddhism ensuring dynastic stability. This context necessitated a systematic review of earlier histories. The state, having repelled the Khitan, was confident but faced growing threats from the Jurchen, fostering a heightened national consciousness. Additionally, amid intense conflicts among aristocratic factions, the text emphasized division as a catalyst for collapse, aiming to critique contemporary issues and impart historical lessons.

The composition features three wild chrysanthemum sprigs branching in three directions atop rocks and grass depicted on the left side of the canvas. The artist distinguishes the rocks and petals with light ink, while the chrysanthemum leaves are rendered in dark ink, creating a harmonious contrast of tone and texture that imparts a lively vitality. The unembellished, understated treatment of the scene is a distinctive characteristic absent in works by other painters. Alongside the Treasure-designated King Jeongjo's Painting of Banana Leaves, this rare surviving example of Jeongjo's oeuvre holds significant value as a critical resource for the study of Korean art history.",

The central Buddha sits on a pedestal with a rounded face and robust physique, exuding a solemn and dignified presence. The robes drape over both shoulders, with a belt knot visible at the chest. The left hand extends downward, while the right hand is raised with all fingers curled. The bodhisattvas flanking the main Buddha wear crowns and bead decorations, holding lotus trays in their hands closest to the central figure. The dense vertical robe patterns on their lower garments are a characteristic feature of statues from the Yeongi area. The main Buddha's halo is circular, adorned with lotus and floral motifs, while the bodhisattvas' halos originally likely formed a boat shape, as suggested by the small Buddha and flame patterns above their heads. Each figure rests on a pedestal with inverted lotus designs. Though sharing stylistic elements with Yeongi's stele statues (carved Buddhist images or inscriptions on stele-shaped stones), the volumetric expression of the main Buddha and the posture of the bodhisattvas indicate this work dates to the late 7th century, showing slight technical advancement.",

It features detailed explanations of each verse by Song Dynasty monk Nammyeongcheon (Fachean). This woodblock-printed edition, transmitted on paper (27.5 cm x 16.6 cm), was recarved in 1239 (26th year of King Gojong of Goryeo) using a metal-type edition originally published by Choe Yi. The text includes a preface by Wu Yongtian Yong (1077) at the beginning and an epilogue by Chu Huang (1076) at the end. Choe Yi’s record notes that, despite the importance of the *Song of Enlightenment* in Seon Buddhism, it had been lost until he recreated the metal-type edition to preserve it for posterity. Wear on the characters suggests it was reprinted in the late Goryeo period, long after the original carving. The uneven and slanted arrangement of text reflects the use of assembled pre-existing characters for the printing blocks. Variations in character size and shape provide critical insights into early Korean metal-type printing techniques. Dated to at least the early 13th century, this text is vital for understanding the timeline and characteristics of Goryeo’s metal-type printing technology.",

This particular sword consists of a gold handle and an iron blade, though they are now separated; originally, they were attached. The handle is intricately carved with two intertwined dragons across its entire surface, and the ring also features two dragons with eyes inlaid with jade. Although only the iron blade remains, it is relatively well-preserved. Predominantly found in Silla tombs, the elaborate dragon designs suggest the sword belonged to a high-ranking noble.",

The concave dial features 7 vertical lines indicating hours and 13 horizontal lines marking seasons. As the sun moves from east to west, the shadow cast on the hour lines reveals the time. Additionally, the varying shadow lengths on the seasonal lines across the 24 solar terms reflect changes in the sun's altitude, allowing users to track the seasons. Notably, historical records in the *Annals of King Sejong* mention that 12 zodiac animal illustrations were added to help illiterate commoners read the time. Beyond its use in the palace, it holds significance as Korea's first public clock, installed at Hyijeonggyo Bridge in Jongno and near Jongmyo Shrine. Both sundials share an elegant, four-legged design with bronze bodies coated in black lacquer, featuring silver-inlaid inscriptions and lines. The cross-shaped legs ensure precise leveling. As a representative Joseon-era sundial and scientific cultural heritage, it remains a highly valued artifact.",

Created by the geographer and scholar Kim Jeong-ho (also known as Gosanja, dates unknown) in 1861 (12th year of King Cheoljong's reign), this map is regarded as the pinnacle of Joseon-era cartography and a masterpiece of traditional Korean maps. \n\nThe map is divided into 22 accordion-folded sections (분첩절첩식), which, when combined, form a large-scale representation of the entire Joseon territory. The first section includes a scale grid, a legend (지도표), a preface (지도유설), and maps of the northernmost regions of Onseong, Jongseong, and Gyeongwon. The preface historically examines the origins and importance of Chinese maps and geographical texts, emphasizing their necessity for politics, economy, defense, and academic research. It also outlines principles for accurate mapmaking. \n\nEach section covers an area of 80 ri (approx. 32 km) east-west and 120 ri (approx. 48 km) north-south. The woodblocks, estimated to number around 70, were engraved on both sides. When fully assembled, the map measures approximately 6.7 meters north-south and 3.8 meters east-west, with a scale of about 1:160,000. \n\nThe map meticulously depicts coastlines, islands, mountains, rivers, and administrative districts. Roads between counties are marked with dots every 10 ri for distance measurement. Within each county, key locations such as military offices (영아), county seats (읍치), fortresses (성지), military garrisons (진보), warehouses (창고), horse-breeding farms (목소), beacon stations (봉수), royal tombs (능침), villages (방리), and historical sites are labeled. \n\nKim Jeong-ho dedicated his life to cartography and geography, producing works like the Yeodo Biji, Dongyeodo Ji, Daedong Ji Ji, Cheonggudo (1834), and the Daedongyeojido. Unlike earlier hand-copied maps, the Daedongyeojido was printed from woodblocks, facilitating wider dissemination of geographical knowledge.

While some sections show traces of manual transcription, supplementation, and repairs—such as missing illustrations, prefaces, and parts of Volume 5 (pages 23–24)—as well as restored covers and annotations in the main text (e.g., Volume 1, page 14), it retains the original form of the woodblocks prior to later re-carving efforts. This makes it a critical bibliographic resource for verifying subsequent editions. Notably, Volumes 4–5 are not included in the previously designated Treasure editions of the same woodblock print, enhancing their rarity. Additionally, as an earlier printed version compared to existing designated artifacts, it holds significant academic value. Given these characteristics, the systematic preservation of this cultural asset is essential to maintain its historical and cultural significance.",

Created by the geographer and scholar Kim Jeong-ho (also known as Gosanja, dates unknown) in 1861 (12th year of King Cheoljong's reign), it represents the zenith of Joseon-era cartography and is celebrated as a masterpiece of historical maps.  \n\nThe map is divided into 22 folded sections (buncheop jeolcheop-sik), which, when assembled, form a comprehensive national map. Each section measures approximately 80 ri (32 km) east-west and 120 ri (48 km) north-south. The entire map spans about 6.7 meters north-south and 3.8 meters east-west, with a scale of approximately 1:160,000. It was printed using around 70 woodblocks, each engraved on both sides.  \n\nThe first section includes a grid system (bang-an-pyo), a legend (jido-pyo), a preface (jido-yuseol), and a detailed map of the capital region (Gyeongdo Obu-jido), alongside maps of the northernmost areas of Onseong, Jongseong, and Gyeongwon. The jido-yuseol emphasizes the historical and practical importance of maps and geographical records for politics, economy, defense, and academia, while outlining principles for accurate cartographic measurement.  \n\nThe map meticulously depicts coastlines, islands, mountain ranges, rivers, and administrative divisions. Roads between counties are marked with dots every 10 ri (4 km) for distance measurement. Within each county, key features such as military offices (yeong-a), county seats (eupchi), fortresses (seongji), garrisons (jinbo), warehouses (changgo), horse breeding grounds (mokso), beacon stations (bongsu), royal tombs (neungchim), villages (bangri), and historical sites (e.g., ancient counties, fortresses, and mountain fortresses) are labeled.  \n\nKim Jeong-ho dedicated his life to cartography and geography, producing seminal works like the Yeodo Bijiseung, Dongyeodo Ji, Daedong Jiji, Cheonggudo (1834), and the Daedongyeojido. Unlike earlier hand-copied maps, the Daedongyeojido was woodblock-printed, facilitating wider dissemination of geographical knowledge.

It is distinguished by its excellent woodblock printing, subtle hand-coloring (blue for rivers and lakes, red borders for counties and garrisons), and preservation state. Unlike most copies, which consist of 22 sections, this version uniquely binds the 21st (Jeju Island's Chuja Island) and 22nd (Jeju Island) sections together, resulting in 21 sections.

Commissioned to pray for the longevity of the crown prince and the protection of the Buddha, the stupa was built at Budongam Hermitage of Bonginsa Temple. Unlike typical stupas housing monastic remains, this one enshrines the Buddha’s sarira. The relics endured significant turmoil during the Japanese colonial period, being illegally exported to Japan in 1927 and only repatriated to Korea in 1987 after over six decades abroad.\n\nThe stupa features an octagonal plan with a three-tiered base (lower, middle, and upper) supporting a drum-shaped body stone that holds the sarira. An eight-sided roof stone crowns the structure, topped by an elongated finial. Its design evokes early Joseon-era stupas, such as those at Cheongnyongsa and Hoeamsa Temples, despite being constructed in the mid-Joseon period. Notable elements include dragon-head carvings at the roof’s eaves and a surrounding stone railing, reflecting continuity with earlier stylistic traditions.\n\nA square niche in the body stone yielded seven relics: three brass vessels, three silver vessels, and a crystal sarira bottle. The brass containers, each holding silk threads, silk, and incense, encase the silver vessels. The silver pieces are adorned with gilded cloud and dragon motifs on their lids and bear inscriptions on their bases, confirming their consecration in 1620 (Gwanghaegun’s 12th year).\n\nThis ensemble is significant as a mid-Joseon work that preserves early Joseon stylistic elements while introducing innovations, such as the elongated finial and the use of seven reliquaries—a departure from the era’s typical practice of using fewer. With a definitively dated creation, it serves as a critical reference for studying Joseon-era Buddhist art and material culture.",

When folded, the upper volume measures 42.3 cm (height) × 15.5 cm (width), while the middle and lower volumes are 49.3 cm × 15.5 cm. The dark blue covers feature silver floral patterns, with the title inscribed in gold on a red background. At the end of the text, a record lists 22 donors, including Choi Cheon-gyeong, who contributed to express gratitude to heaven, earth, parents, and the nation, and to pray for rebirth in the Pure Land after death. Unlike Goryeo-era sutras commissioned by royalty or aristocrats, this manuscript was produced through donations by commoners and low-born individuals, making it a critical resource for studying early Joseon Buddhist manuscript traditions.",

Known as the 'Mitachambeop' (Amitabha Repentance Ritual), it gained significant popularity in Korea since the Three Kingdoms period among devotees aspiring to rebirth in the Western Pure Land. The book is a woodblock-printed edition on hanji (Korean traditional paper), bound in two volumes: Volume 1–5 as one book and Volume 6–10 as another. It measures 37 cm in height and 24 cm in width, with a light-green cloth cover inscribed with the title 'Jeongto Mun' (Pure Land Text). The opening section depicts the Three Cosmic Buddhas (Past, Present, and Future) with their names, followed by the main text. A 1474 preface by Kim Su-on at the end lists prominent monks, royal relatives, and contributors involved in the carving and publication, highlighting its meticulous execution as a state-sponsored project by the Joseon royal court. Though not widely circulated due to its royal patronage, it was reprinted by Haeinsa Temple in 1503 and is now included in the Haeinsa Tripitaka Koreana (National Treasure). As a royal initiative, it represents the highest artistic and technical standards of early Joseon, with contributions from elite calligraphers, illustrators, and woodblock carvers.",

King Yeongjo implemented the Tangpyeong Policy to address severe factional strife, stabilized society by equitably appointing talented individuals, and fostered a cultural renaissance through his personal dedication to scholarship. This painting, depicting Yeongjo at the age of 51, was executed in colored pigments on silk, measuring 68 cm in width and 110 cm in height. The portrait portrays him facing to the right, wearing an ikseongwan (royal hat) and a red gonryongpo (dragon-embroidered robe) adorned with dragon motifs on the shoulders and chest. His face exhibits a reddish hue, with upturned eyes, a high nasal bridge, sharply defined nostrils, and straight lines at the corners of the mouth, rendered in a sculptural style. The geokdae (decorative belt) on his chest is elevated, and the absence of distinct outlines on the robe reflects the portraiture style of the late Joseon period. This portrait, created in 1900 by leading contemporary portrait artists, is a faithful copy of the original painting executed by Jang Gyeong-ju and Kim Du-ryang in the 20th year of Yeongjo’s reign (1744).

The mouth is slightly flared and attached to the middle of the body, while the oval-shaped foot is affixed to the opposite side, allowing the vessel to be stood upright on its side. The surface was coated with white slip applied using a brush, leaving visible brushmarks. Freehand peony vine patterns, rendered in underglaze iron-brown pigment with bold stylistic omissions, adorn one side, while a cross (十) is depicted on the rounded body. The thick slip layer and expressive brushwork exemplify the distinctive characteristics of Joseon Buncheong ware. This piece is a representative example of the 'gwiyal' technique, where slip is applied with a brush to create textured patterns, showcasing the genre's unique aesthetic through its spontaneous and daring design elements.",

Over this, black iron pigment was applied with fluid brushwork, skillfully blending light and dark tones for an elegant effect. The high, wide foot has Korean script inscribed on the inner base. Iron-painted white porcelain emerged in the late 15th century but remains rare from the 15th to 16th centuries. This bottle is a precious example from the late 16th century, distinguished by its unique string motif cascading from the neck—a hallmark of early Joseon ceramic artistry.",

Printed via woodblock on hanji (Korean traditional paper), the two-volume set is bound as a single book, though the first page of the upper volume and several final pages are missing. Its dimensions are 26.5 cm (height) × 16.5 cm (width). Notably, while most surviving copies of the Five Commentaries include explanatory notes (설의) by early Joseon monk Gi Hwa (己和), this version lacks them and instead appends a 'Resolution of Doubts' (결의) at the end, suggesting Gi Hwa’s commentary was composed later.",

One volume (Volumes 5–7) retains silk on its spine, suggesting it originally had a silk-covered binding (포배장).\n\nTranslated into Chinese by Kumārajīva (344–413 CE) of the Yaoqin dynasty, the Lotus Sutra is one of the most important early Mahayana scriptures. As the foundational text of the Tiantai (Cheontae) school, it was adopted as a core subject in Korean Buddhist seminaries and profoundly influenced the development of Korean Buddhist thought alongside the Avataṃsaka Sutra.\n\nThe Bomunsa Temple copy is identified as a later printed edition from the reign of King Seongjong (1470–1494), not the original print, based on wear patterns on the characters and guidelines.

The face is rendered with flesh tones outlined in brown, while the lips, painted in a slightly darker ochre, convey a subdued expression. The outer lines of the robe are angular, and the lining visible through the side slit of the garment appears stiffly starched. Though the subject differs, the portrait shares stylistic and formal similarities with those of Jang Mal-son and Son So, suggesting it was likely commissioned in 1476 (7th year of King Seongjong's reign) when portraits of all merit subjects were ordered.

Most surviving Goryeo Buddhist paintings focus on Amitabha, often illustrating scenes of him preaching in the Pure Land or welcoming devotees who practice chanting. Unlike typical depictions where Amitabha faces to the right, this figure is shown facing forward. Clad in a red kasaya (monastic robe) and green jangsam (outer robe), Amitabha stands with legs slightly apart, left hand placed near the chest and right hand lowered. A circular halo, rendered in gold powder, adorns the back of his head. The use of red and green robes alongside gold-patterned halos reflects characteristic features of Goryeo Buddhist art. Though lacking an inscription, the overall composition closely resembles a Goryeo-era Amitabha Buddha standing painting housed in Japan's Tōkai-an Temple, supporting its attribution to the Goryeo period. Notably, the right hand forms the middle mudra (thumb and middle finger touching), while the left hand exhibits no mudra—a unique inversion of hand gestures compared to other extant works, making this piece a rare example.",

A tankhwa refers to a Buddhist painting on fabric or paper, framed as a scroll or panel for hanging. During the mid-Joseon period, such paintings often combined Buddhist and Confucian themes of filial piety. This particular work features a landscape-style background and is divided into three tiers. The upper tier depicts an ideal Buddhist realm with the Three Buddha (Seokgamoni, Vairocana, and Nosana) and Seven Buddhas, a rare inclusion influenced by Huayan Buddhist thought. The middle tier shows a ritual table with monks performing ceremonies for starving pretas (hungry ghosts), demarcated by lightning and gold lines to signify sacred space. The lower tier illustrates the cycle of rebirth, including hell and the realm of pretas. The monks' robes, ritual instruments like drums and bells, and other details provide valuable insights into contemporary Buddhist practices. Created in 1681 (7th year of King Sukjong's reign), this painting is the second oldest extant Gamro Tankhwa after the 1649 version in the National Museum of Korea. Its landscape-style composition is characteristic of Joseon Buddhist art and serves as a critical resource for studying mid-to-late Joseon Gamro Tankhwa.",

      "content_en": "This is a relatively large white porcelain water dropper with eight sides. A water dropper (yeonjeok) is a vessel used to hold water for grinding ink on an inkstone. During the Goryeo period, such objects were primarily made of celadon, while in the Joseon period, white porcelain became the dominant material. The top of this water dropper features a three-dimensional depiction of clouds and dragons, intricately carved using various techniques to create a dynamic and lifelike expression. The eight sides are adorned with paintings of the 'Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang' (Sosangpalgyeong)—eight iconic landscapes where the Xiao and Xiang Rivers converge in China—rendered with skilled brushwork. While the specific themes of the landscapes are not explicitly detailed, the compositions are tightly structured and showcase notable artistic merit. On one side, where the water outlet is located, a poem replaces the painted scene. It identifies the theme as 'Autumn Moon over Dongting Lake' (Dongjeong Chuwol), one of the Eight Views, with two poetic lines flanking the central title. The use of cobalt-blue underglaze pigment for the designs suggests this piece was created in the 19th century, a period marked by experimentation in ceramic techniques. The vibrant dragon motif and painterly landscapes reflect the era's distinctive characteristics, making this object a valuable example of Joseon white porcelain craftsmanship.",

It is designed in an accordion-fold style (buncheop jeolcheop-sik), allowing it to be folded and unfolded like a screen. Comprising a total of 23 sections, the first section serves as an index, while sections 1 to 22 depict regional geography, mirroring the structure of the Daedongyeojido. The map delineates mountain ranges and rivers, with boundaries between states and counties (juhyeon) marked to indicate roads. Overlaid on this base are symbols for military camps (yeongjin), counties (juhyeon), fortresses (jinbo), postal routes (yeokdo), horse-breeding farms (mokso), wards (bangmyeon), warehouses (changgo), beacon stations (bongsu), royal tombs (neungchim), castles (seong), roads (doro), and guard posts (pasu). The scale is indicated on the first section with a grid, noting 'Bang Sipri Mae-pyeon' (each square represents ten ri, approximately 3.93 kilometers). Dongyeodo is regarded as the most beautifully and precisely crafted manuscript copy of the Daedongyeojido, rivaling the technical excellence of maps produced by the Royal Painting School (Dohwaseo). Its superb illustrations, calligraphy, and coloration exemplify the advanced cartographic techniques of late 18th-century Joseon, making it a representative masterpiece of the era.",

This bottle shares stylistic similarities with Northern Song Dynasty Cizhou kiln wares, particularly in its form and decorative motifs. The glaze, often oxidized during firing, typically exhibits a yellowish-brown hue, while the bold, thickly applied iron-painted designs convey a vibrant energy. The bottle features a flat, flared mouth, rounded shoulders, and a nearly straight body descending to the foot—a form considered an early, less-refined iteration of the Goryeo-style *maebyeong* (bottle), retaining characteristics of Chinese prototypes. The iron-painted motifs are applied thickly, creating raised, glossy black-brown patterns. A horizontal band divides the vessel into upper and lower registers: the narrower upper section bears a stylized chrysanthemum scroll, while the broader lower section depicts a large melon vine (절지문) intertwined with a bird, a pair of butterflies, and a bee. The glaze, though light yellowish, remains translucent and lacks crazing. The foot is trimmed on the interior, with traces of coarse sand used as a firing support. As a masterpiece of Goryeo iron-painted celadon, this piece is celebrated for its unconventional composition, dynamic brushwork, and harmonious contrast between the greenish-brown glaze and deep black-brown iron-painted designs.",

The composition employs a bird's-eye view to capture the vastness of the scene, with buildings rendered using diagonal parallel perspective slanting from the upper right to the lower left. To convey spatial depth, the sizes of mountain peaks and trees diminish gradually toward the upper part of the screen. However, the color palette does not emphasize atmospheric perspective, as distant peaks and structures remain sharply defined rather than blurred. The screen is densely populated with trees: pine trees line the ridges in the distant view, while mid- and foreground hills and villages feature vibrantly colored foliage of various species, a trend also observed in some 19th-century documentary paintings. Mountains are depicted with earthen ridges (tosan) using fine dots (mijeom) and swept-rock textures (amsan). The distant pine trees evoke the style of Lee Ui-yang (1768–?), leading to speculation that this screen may have been painted by artists associated with him.\n\nStarting from the right panel, the first panel shows Seodaemun Gate [Dunyimun] and the Guard Command Headquarters (Sumunjangcheong). The fourth panel features a gate inscribed with 'Giyoung' (圻營), denoting the provincial office. The central building in the sixth panel is Seonhwadang, the governor's office. The eighth panel includes Yeongeunmun Gate and Mohwagwan Hall, with a lotus pond spanning panels eight to nine. The tenth panel depicts Daeheon Peak, Soheon Peak, and Eupseongjeong Archery Ground. The final panel shows a shooting pavilion (Sajeong). Beyond these landmarks, the painting includes minor structures like latrines, warehouses, thatched and tiled houses, and shops such as herbal medicine stores, shoe shops, rice vendors, taverns, and market stalls. The vitality of the scene arises from dynamic daily life: processions, laborers, and interactions that blend landscape, cartography, and genre painting—a hallmark of 'seongsidoh' (cityscape) traditions.\n\nThe most prominent narrative is the procession of the Gyeonggi Governor, stretching from panels three to six. The mounted figure, presumed to be the governor, is distinctively detailed with facial features, emphasizing his status. Accompanied by a processional band, attendants, and spectators, the scene brims with realism. Elsewhere, scholars rest under pines, officers converse casually, grooms wait with horses, women carry water jars, a scholar rides with a page, a candy vendor sharpens scissors, laborers bear loads, farmers work fields, and women carry meal containers—all rendered with lively spontaneity.

It is part of an 81-volume compilation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, likely combining the 80-volume edition with the final volume of the 40-volume edition (Bohyeonhaengwonpum) or integrating three versions of the sutra. Volume 15 contains the latter half of the 12th section (Hyunsubum), where Manjushri Bodhisattva requests Hyunsu Bodhisattva to recite verses (gathas) describing the luminosity, meditative absorption (samadhi), and spiritual power (weishenli) attained through practice. The manuscript includes a colophon detailing its commission by Jeongjeokmandara (a high-ranking Yuan-Goryeo official titled Yeongnokdaebu and Huijeongsa), who dedicated the 81-volume Avatamsaka Sutra and 10-volume Shurangama Sutra to the well-being of his parents, the Yuan emperor, and the Goryeo king. Accompanied by intricate illustrated diagrams (byeonsangdo) and a colophon specifying its creation date, patron, and purpose, this artifact holds significant value for studying 14th-century art history, Buddhist culture, and diplomatic exchanges between Goryeo and Yuan.",

A white-text oval seal reading 'A Traveler Riding an Ox' (기우유자) appears on the left, alongside Kim's handwritten transcription of the full text of 'Autumn Sounds Fu,' dated to his 61st year.  \n\nThe composition portrays an autumn night scene: barren mountains under a moonlit sky, a Chinese-style thatched cottage (초옥) at the center, and Ouyang Xiu seated inside. A servant exits the cottage, gesturing toward the sound of wind rustling through trees, as described in the poem—'The stars and moon shine brightly, but there is no human sound; the noise comes from the trees' (星月皎潔, 明下在天, 四無人聲, 聲在樹間). Two cranes stretch their necks and open their beaks in response to the wind, while fallen leaves scatter in the courtyard.

Ma Cheon-mok received this certificate as a third-rank merit subject. This document is the only extant copy among the 47 certificates issued to Left-Captaining Merit Subjects.

      "content_en": "This portrait is believed to be the image of Lee Seong-yun (1570–1620) awarded when he was recorded as a 2nd-class Meritorious Subject for the Protection of the King (Weiseong Gongsin) in 1613 (the 5th year of King Gwanghae’s reign). During the 1623 Injo Restoration, which deposed King Gwanghae, all titles and records of the meritorious subjects—including the Weiseong, Iksa, Jeongun, and Haengnan—were revoked, and their official portraits and documents were confiscated and destroyed. As a result, portraits from Gwanghae’s era have remained largely unknown. However, this portrait and the corresponding meritorious subject document have been preserved in the descendant’s family.\n\nThe portrait exemplifies the typical style of early 17th-century meritorious subject portraits. Lee is depicted wearing a danryeong (rank-based robe), seated with clasped hands on a chair, facing slightly to the right. A vibrant colored carpet covers the floor, and his feet rest on a wooden footrest covered with a mat, spread in a slight V-shape. Despite being a 2nd-class meritorious subject, the portrait’s elaborate use of gold, vivid mineral pigments, and meticulous detailing reflect Lee’s high social status as a royal relative and his respected character. It is considered one of the finest examples of early 17th-century meritorious subject portraits.\n\nDimensions: 178.4 x 106.35 cm (painting), 256.5 x 122.7 cm (entire frame).",

Commissioned in 1455 (1st year of King Sejo’s reign) by scholars Choi Hang (崔恒), No Sa-sin (盧思愼), and Seo Geo-jeong (徐居正), it underwent multiple revisions before the final version, the 'Eulsa Daejeon' (乙巳大典), was completed in 1485 (16th year of King Seongjong’s reign). This text served as the primary legal framework of Joseon until the late Joseon period, making it an indispensable resource for studying early Joseon legal history, institutional systems, and bibliographical research. The 1485 woodblock-printed edition (initial Jip-inja type) and mixed-type prints are exceptionally rare and historically significant. The copy held by the Samsung Publishing Museum corresponds to the earlier 'Sinmyo Daejeon' (辛卯大典) of 1471 (2nd year of King Seongjong’s reign), which was promulgated in November 1470 and implemented from January 1471. It contains Volumes 1–2, covering the 'Ijeon' (吏典, Personnel Code) and 'Hojeon' (戶典, Household and Tax Code), printed using the initial Jip-inja metal type. As the oldest surviving edition of the Gyeongguk Daejeon, despite partial damage, it holds immense rarity and scholarly value due to the absence of other extant copies of these volumes. Additionally, it complements the already designated Treasure, 'Gyeongguk Daejeon, Volume 3,' enhancing its historical significance. The identification of this Sinmyo Daejeon copy marks a breakthrough in Joseon legal history research and is expected to be widely utilized in future studies. Despite not being a complete set, its critical role in understanding Joseon’s legal system and metal-type printing technology underscores its eligibility for designation as a Treasure to ensure its preservation and academic study.",

      "content_en": "This scripture, authored by the Indian monk Dharmatrāta (法救) and translated by Saṅghavarman (僧伽跋摩) and others during the Liu Song dynasty (435 CE), is a woodblock-printed text from the 11th-century First Tripitaka Koreana (초조대장경). As Volume 9 of 11, it represents a key treatise of the Sarvāstivāda (說一切有部) school, a subsect of the Hinayana tradition. The text is structured into 12 sections, with Volume 9 focusing on the 'Miscellaneous Section' (잡품), which discusses philosophical concepts such as non-apprehension (不相應), the three non-conditioned elements (三無爲), the nine fruits of practice (九果), and spiritual powers (神足).\n\nPhysically, the volume features a title inscription 'Kṣudrakābhidharma-Heart Treatise, Volume 9' (雜阿毗曇心論 卷第九) and a case marker 'Do' (都) at the beginning. The translator's name, 'Song Indian Tripiṭaka Master Saṅghavarman et al.' (宋天竺三藏僧伽跋摩 等譯), is noted in three lines. The text lacks boundary lines (無界), with each line containing approximately 14 characters. Pages typically have 23 lines (22 on the opening page), though line counts vary slightly depending on the panel size. The scroll-binding format (권자본) connects pages tightly, obscuring the central title imprint (판심제). At the end, wooden axes (목축) of 30.3 cm length and 0.8 cm diameter are coated with red lacquer. The cover bears a handwritten title 'Kṣudrakābhidharma-Heart Treatise, Volume 9, Do' (雜阿毗曇心論卷第九 都), with a 30.9 cm margin before the text and a preserved bamboo strip (表竹) attached with a cloth string, indicating its original form.\n\nAs part of the First Tripitaka Koreana, this volume is an invaluable resource for research on Goryeo Buddhist canon, Buddhist studies, and bibliography.",

The title, written in red seal script at the top, is accompanied by regional names inscribed in circles of white, red, yellow, brown, green, and blue. Beacon stations are depicted as candle-like symbols atop mountain peaks, densely clustered along the Amnok and Tumen Rivers, as well as in the Gyeongsang Province. The map meticulously details administrative centers, islands, mountain ranges, peaks, and river systems, offering a clear overview of the primary beacon routes.\n\nBeyond its historical significance in showcasing Joseon-era communication systems, the map exhibits remarkable artistic qualities. Mountainous regions are rendered with dynamic brushstrokes and effective use of blue-green pigments. Baekdu Mountain, the ancestral peak (종산) of the Korean peninsula, is prominently emphasized in white, as is Geumgangsan. The sea is depicted with rhythmic bluish-green water wave patterns (수파묘), characterized by interlocking curves resembling clasped hands, adding vibrancy to the composition. These intricate wave patterns, formed by consistent fine curves, enhance the map's visual rhythm and artistic appeal.\n\nThe map's creation is estimated to the late 17th century, based on the inclusion of Kimcheon (formed in 1652) and the absence of the 1712 Baekdu Mountain Boundary Marker (정계비). Measuring over 2 meters in height, it is a masterpiece in both cartography and art history, celebrated for its detailed depiction of beacon routes and artistic excellence.",

The collection includes maps of 20 counties within Hwanghae Province and a general map of the province (Hwanghae-do Jeondo). However, maps of three counties—Munhwa, Sinchon, and Anak—are missing. The third volume bears a stamp of the Biwonseo on the reverse of the Baecheon Map, confirming its historical use and ownership by the office. Excluding the general provincial map, the 20 county maps are drawn on grid paper (bang-an-ji). Roads are color-coded: red for major roads, blue for medium roads, and yellow for minor roads, while beacon roads are marked with thin red lines. The maps depict geographical features such as mountains, rivers, administrative divisions (myeon), bridges, Confucian academies, granaries, and temples. Marginal annotations provide foundational data, including household counts (minho), taxable land (jeongyeol), tax grains (segok), and administrative units (myeon-ri).",

Originally consisting of 8 volumes, only 6 books remain today. The collection is organized as follows: Book 1 (Gyeonggi Province), Book 2 (Haseo Jeondo and Gwanseo Jeondo), Book 3 (Gwandong Jeondo and Bukgwan Jeondo), Book 4 (Seobuk Piyanggye Jeondo), Book 5 (Yeongnam Jeondo), Book 6 (Hoseo Jeondo), Book 7 (Honam Jeondo), and Book 8 (Paldo Chongdo). Books 4 and 8 are large-scale comprehensive maps. The statistical data on population and land records in the maps reflect information from 1748–1750 (King Yeongjo’s reign), indicating the collection was compiled in the mid-18th century. It is presumed to have been created with reference to earlier maps produced by the State Council (Biryeongsa). The maps uniformly depict each district in a pictorial style, with marginal annotations detailing population, land area, grain production, historical records, geography, administrative names, historical sites, post stations, schools, Buddhist temples, local products, and directional indicators. This suggests the maps were designed for local governance and were likely produced by the Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan), which collaborated with the State Council on cartography. Haedong Jido is notable for systematically illustrating the geographical and historical details of all districts in the late 18th century, aligning with contemporary geographical compilations.

It is not listed in the official *Register of Seals and Tokens* (*Boin Busin Chongsul*), likely due to its clandestine purpose.

The seal’s small size and portable storage case (with built-in red ink) align with its role in covert operations. Its creation coincided with the establishment of the *Jeguk Ikmunsa*, a secret intelligence agency under Gojong’s direct control, which likely facilitated the seal’s use in anti-Japanese resistance efforts.

The seal was repatriated to South Korea on August 15, 1946, under U.S. military administration, and transferred to the National Museum of Korea on June 28, 1954, where it remains preserved today.\n\nThe seal comprises a dragon-shaped handle (yongnyu), a shallow base (yudae), and the body (bosin), inscribed in neat small seal script (sojeon). Unlike Joseon-era royal seals, which featured turtle-shaped handles (ginyu), this seal adopts a dragon motif, reflecting the Korean Empire's imperial symbolism. The inclusion of a yudae beneath the handle is also characteristic of seals from this period.\n\nDespite minor discoloration, the seal retains its original form, with the dragon handle and inscriptions intact. As a well-preserved example of a Korean Empire-era national seal, it symbolizes Emperor Gojong's efforts to centralize military authority and pursue autonomous reforms through strengthened defense capabilities.",

This piece is a cursive rendition of the first of five pentasyllabic poems from the Tang dynasty poet Zhu Guangxi's (儲光羲) collection 『Nagyangdo (洛陽道)』. Originally a bound scroll, it was later remounted as a hanging scroll in the modern era. Yang Sa-eon, alongside Hwang Gilo, was celebrated as one of Joseon's preeminent cursive calligraphers, deeply influenced by the free-spirited styles of Tang dynasty masters Zhang Xu (張旭) and Huai Su (懷素). His work reflects a Daoist-infused artistic philosophy, characterized by dynamic, rounded brushstrokes (圓筆勢) and unbridled creativity. This piece exemplifies his mastery of large-character cursive script (大字草書), embodying his reclusive temperament and aesthetic ideals. Notably, it includes 1749 annotations by later Joseon calligraphers Yi Gwang-sa (李匡師) and Jo Myeong-gyo (曹命敎), enhancing its historical and artistic value. Yang's other surviving works, such as the Treasure-designated 『Bongrae Yumuk (蓬萊遺墨)』 and poems in 『Geunmeok (槿墨)』, further underscore his legacy as a literary and calligraphic icon.",

Yi Jeung, from the Hansan Yi clan, served as Minister of Rites and was posthumously honored with the title Uigangong (懿簡公) and enfeoffed as Archeon-gun (鵞川君).

Yeongyeongdang was built by Crown Prince Hyomyeong (later posthumously titled King Ikjong) to host banquets for his parents, King Sunjo and Queen Sunwon, around 1827–1828. Initially used for royal audiences and rituals, it later housed portraits and memorials of Crown Prince Hyomyeong until 1857, when they were relocated due to dampness. During the Gojong era, it served as a diplomatic space for hosting foreign envoys and state banquets. The sarangchae rests on a stone platform with trapezoidal foundations and square pillars, featuring a guldori roof structure (where beams support rafters).

West of Juhamnu Pavilion stands Seohyangak (Scholar’s Fragrance Hall), while behind Juhamnu, on a two-tiered stone platform, is the small pavilion Jewolgwangpunggwan (View of Cleared Moonlight and Breeze). Further west, Heeujeong Pavilion overlooks the area, and the Satjeong Gibi-gak (Stele Pavilion of the Four Wells) stands on the pond’s western side.\n\nHistorical records indicate that Buyongjeong was originally built as Taeksuje in 1707 during King Sukjong’s reign and renamed during King Jeongjo’s era. The Dongguk Yeoji Bigo notes a decorated boat on the pond used by King Jeongjo for flower appreciation and fishing. The pavilion hosted banquets for civil exam passers and poetic gatherings; in 1795, King Jeongjo fished here with officials. Ten poetic couplets (ju-ryeon) describing the scenery hang on its pillars.\n\nArchitecturally, Buyongjeong is a cross-shaped (ten-shaped) pavilion with 5 front kan, 4 side kan, and 3 rear kan. Half-kan extensions on the southeast and southwest enhance connectivity, with east-west symmetry along the north-south axis. Built on two octagonal stone pillars in the pond, slender wooden columns support a delicately proportioned two-eokgong bracket system. Inside, four rooms are arranged, with the rear room elevated. The roof is a single-story hip-and-gable (paljak) with double eaves.\n\nThe pavilion’s exterior contrasts simplicity in the north with ornate detailing in the south. Railings include flat and egg-shaped (gyeja) designs, with the northern pond-side railing raised for visual variation. Windows feature arrowhead lattice (a-salmun) on pond-facing sections and belt lattice (tti-salmun) elsewhere, while internal windows use octagonal lattice (pal-gak) for spatial division. Buyongjeong exemplifies Korean pavilion architecture, blending natural and artificial elements to create a space for scholarly cultivation and aesthetic enjoyment. Its unique cross-shaped plan, spatial composition, and decorative harmony showcase exceptional proportional balance and contrast, earning it high historical, artistic, and architectural value.",

      "content_en": "Hyangwonjeong Pavilion is a hexagonal two-story pavilion located on an island in Hyangwonji Pond within the northern garden of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The name 'Hyangwon' (香遠), meaning 'fragrance travels far,' is derived from Zhou Dunyi's essay 'Love of Lotus' (1017–1073), symbolizing the serene retreat for kings and royalty. Originally, the site featured Chuirojeong Pavilion built in 1456 during King Sejo's reign, as recorded in the Annals of King Sejo. The current pond, spanning 4,605㎡, is a square-shaped lotus pond with rounded corners, inhabited by lotuses, aquatic plants, and fish. Its water source is the 'Yeolsangjinwon' spring on the northern hillside.\n\nThe wooden bridge 'Chwihyanggyo,' leading to the pavilion, was destroyed during the Korean War (1950–1953) and temporarily replaced with a stone bridge in 1953. After archaeological research, the original wooden bridge (32m long, 165cm wide) was restored in 2021. The pavilion's construction is estimated to have been completed in 1885, based on dendrochronological analysis of timber used in 1881 and 1884. It was part of King Gojong's efforts to establish political independence from his father, Heungseon Daewongun, during the construction of Gyeoncheonggung Palace in 1873.\n\nArchitecturally, Hyangwonjeong features a hexagonal plan with identical upper and lower floors. It rests on a low stone foundation with hexagonal columns supporting both levels. The bracket system (mureukgong) includes decorative elements like rounded soffits and a single-tiered beam structure. The first floor has a flat rail balcony, while the second floor features a lattice rail. The roof is a hexagonal hipped design with a decorative finial (jeolbyeongtong) at the apex. All windows are fitted with lattice shutters, and the interior has a coffered ceiling.\n\nHyangwonjeong is a symbol of the palace's northern garden, blending historical, artistic, and architectural value. Its meticulous hexagonal design, harmonious proportions, and serene setting reflect the pinnacle of Joseon-era pavilion architecture, serving as a representative space for royal leisure and contemplation.",

Although the Buddha shrine (불감) is significantly damaged, it provides crucial insights into the form of early Joseon-era shrines and serves as a benchmark for studying Buddhist iconography of the period. The iconography inside and outside the shrine—including the Trinity of Buddhas (삼신불) on the front, the slender and elongated pagoda style characteristic of early Joseon, depictions of Avalokitesvara and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattvas on the sides, and the Buddha’s sermon scene on the back—are linked to iconographic trends popular in the early Joseon period. The accompanying construction vow document reveals the artifacts’ close association with the Joseon royal court, particularly through an inscription on the base of the gilt-bronze Seated Vairocana Buddha statue, which identifies the patron as Queen Dowager Jeongui (貞懿大王大妃). Additionally, the sculptor Seong-in (性仁), recorded in the inscription, is noted for his activity in the early 17th century and is likely the same artist who crafted the Vairocana Buddha statue at Jijangam Hermitage in Seoul. The 15th-century statues appear to inherit traditions from late Goryeo Buddhist sculptures, while the 17th-century figures, with their disproportionate, crouching postures, exhibit a humorous yet era-reflective style. Despite uncertainties surrounding the circumstances of their enshrinement in the pagoda and the scattered locations of some associated statues, this collection represents a pivotal example of early Joseon royal Buddhist art, accompanied by historical documents and inscriptions.",

It expounds on the mystical merits of the Buddha’s actions, speech, and thoughts through Esoteric Buddhist teachings, categorized into the three mysteries (body, speech, mind). The colophon of this Initial Tripitaka edition (초조대장경) indicates it was carved and presented in the 11th month of 1002 (5th year of Xianping, Song Dynasty). Later included in the ｢Da Zhong Xiangfu Faobao Lu｣ (大中祥符法寶錄) compiled in 1031, the woodblocks were relocated to the Shenshou Chan Monastery in Kaifeng in 1071. The printed version reached Goryeo, where it was re-carved after 1087 during King Seonjong’s reign, becoming part of the Initial Tripitaka as a later addition (추조본). This volume exemplifies the post-carving integration of texts into the Initial Tripitaka, as recorded in the ｢Sinpyeon Jejong Gyojang Chongrok｣ (新編諸宗敎藏總錄) compiled by National Preceptor Uicheon. Despite damage to the first two pages, it remains a rare surviving copy of the Initial Tripitaka’s supplementary editions.",

The First Tripitaka Edition of this text, dated to the 12th century, is believed to have been printed based on the Kaiyuan Tripitaka (開寶板大藏經) of the Song dynasty. It bears the case number 'Bong (封)' and consists of six wooden printing panels. The paper cover is inscribed with the title 'Manjushri’s One Hundred and Eight Names in Sanskrit Praises (文殊一百八名梵讚)' and the case number 'Bong' in ink.

Although the lower portion is missing, its historical value lies in vividly illustrating the daily life and religious beliefs of the era, unlike other contemporary bronze artifacts. The plowing scene is interpreted as a ritual symbolizing the start of spring and prayers for abundance, reminiscent of the 'Nogyung' (naked plowing) or 'Gigyeongsok' (plowing customs) practiced in later periods in Hamgyeong and Pyeongan provinces. The figure below is believed to represent a woman harvesting in autumn, with a jar resembling the Early Iron Age 'Black-burnished Long-necked Jar (黑陶長頸壺)' placed beside her. The bird motif on the reverse is associated with the 'Sotdae' (솟대) poles and 'Sin'gan' (신간, sacred poles) described in historical texts like the *Records of the Three Kingdoms (三國志)* and the *Book of the Later Han (後漢書)*. These poles, part of shamanic traditions widespread in Korea and Siberia, symbolize guiding souls to the afterlife.

The composition evokes a poetic, airy spaciousness, as cranes and clouds are sparsely arranged against the jade-green glaze, reminiscent of an open sky. The meticulous inlay technique and even application of a high-quality celadon glaze, fired to perfection under reducing conditions, result in a lustrous, glassy surface with minimal flaws. The pristine preservation state, nearly devoid of damage, further elevates its status. As a pinnacle of Goryeo inlaid celadon—recognized globally for its technical and artistic brilliance—this piece exemplifies the zenith of Korean ceramic achievement and warrants designation as a National Treasure.",

Currently housed in the National Museum of Korea, this artifact features a body and lid of nearly equal height. The lid rises hemispherically toward the center, crowned with a lotus-shaped knob. Around the knob, a thick 10-petal floral pattern (hwamun) is encircled by one line of raised concentric circles, followed by three spaced lines, and another three lines near the rim. The body tapers roundly downward to a flat base, with raised concentric circles along its sides: one at the rim, three at the center, three lower down, and one at the base.

While Arhat veneration flourished throughout the Goryeo era, only a few works, including this painting and the 7th Arhat (Gariga), have survived. The inscription on the painting originally read '第十五 阿代多尊者' (15th Adaita Arhat), but later texts, such as the 1809 『Five Hundred Saints' Invitation Text』 by Yeongpaseonggyu (影波聖奎), refer to him as '第十五 阿伐多尊者' (15th Abadaya Arhat). This discrepancy is likely due to a transcription error during later restoration. The painting portrays the elderly Arhat leaning on a staff, seated on a chair, with dynamic facial expressions that convey vitality despite his aged appearance. The composition emphasizes negative space, creating a stable and serene atmosphere, while variations in ink tones enhance depth and three-dimensionality. Delicate brushwork, realistic human figures, and subtle contrasts between white, red, and dark ink contribute to its refined aesthetic.

      "content_en": "Changuimun (Gate of Manifesting Righteousness) is one of the four minor gates (Sasomun) of the Seoul City Wall, located in the northwest. Constructed in 1396 during the fifth year of King Taejo’s reign, it served as a transportation route to Yangju and Goyang alongside Sukjeongmun. However, it was closed in 1416 during King Taejong’s reign due to geomantic principles, reopening in 1506 under King Jungjong. Notably, it was the site where Prince Nongyang and his rebel forces breached the gate during the 1623 Injo Restoration, leading to a successful coup. \n\nThe gate’s wooden superstructure was destroyed during the Imjin War (1592–1598) but rebuilt between 1741 and 1742 under King Yeongjo. During this reconstruction, plaques engraved with the names of the Injo Restoration’s loyalists were installed on the gatehouse. \n\nThe foundation (yukjuk) was built with large granite stones similar to Sungnyemun and Heunginjimun, with parapets (deungseong) on both sides. While the northern parapet follows a typical ‘ㄷ’-shaped design, the southern section adapts to the descending terrain. The gatehouse features a hip-and-gable roof (ujingak jib) with three bays on the front and two on the sides. The parapet walls are constructed without gun ports (chong’an) using glazed bricks. \n\nStructurally, the framework rests directly on crossbeams placed atop brackets (judu) on plain columns (pyeongju). Secondary brackets (hwanban) support the main beams (marutbo) and secondary rafters (jungdori). A trapezoidal purlin block (paryeondae-gong) holds the upper rafters (marutdori), which are connected via floating purlins (tteun-changbang), lintels (jangyeo), and beams. The ceiling is an exposed rafter style (yeondeung cheongjang). The eaves are double-layered (gyeopcheoma) with moderately sloped roofs. The ridge is adorned with decorative tiles (yangseongmaru), dragon heads (yongdu), mythical figures (japsang), and toe-soo finials on the eave ends. \n\nAs one of only three surviving gatehouses of the Seoul City Wall (alongside Sungnyemun and Heunginjimun), Changuimun exemplifies late Joseon Dynasty architectural norms. It is the sole minor gate reconstructed in the 18th century post-Imjin War, retaining its original form. Its historical significance, architectural authenticity, and well-preserved foundations and parapets underscore its academic and cultural value as a key component of Seoul’s defensive heritage.",

While arhat worship persisted throughout the Goryeo period, only a few painted works from this tradition remain. The National Museum of Korea currently houses six panels from this series: No. 92 Guardian of the Great Dharma Arhat (守大藏尊者), No. 125 Miraculous Treasure Store Arhat (辰寶藏尊者), No. 145 Joyful Contemplation Arhat (喜見尊者), No. 170 Meditative Incense Burner Arhat (慧軍高尊者), No. 357 Virtuous Practice Arhat (義通尊者), and No. 427 Fulfillment of Vows Arhat (願圓滿尊者). Each arhat is depicted in dynamic poses: No. 92 holds a reliquary, No. 125 demonstrates supernatural powers, No. 145 gazes into the distance in deep thought, No. 170 burns incense in meditation, No. 357 practices with a ritual scepter, and No. 427 offers incense. The paintings typically feature mountainous landscapes as backdrops, emphasizing ascetic practices and miraculous acts in secluded natural settings.  \n\nDating to 1235–1236 (during the 22nd year of King Gojong’s reign), the works were commissioned by Kim Ui-in (隊正 金義仁), as indicated by surviving inscriptions. Measuring approximately 55–60 cm in height and 35–40 cm in width, the paintings are executed on silk (絹本) with minimal color applied to details like lips, hair, textiles, and ritual objects, relying primarily on ink wash for a subdued aesthetic. Techniques such as *moist ink shading* (발묵법) create spatial depth and three-dimensionality in robes and halos, while white undergarments peeking from monastic robes add elegance. The bold yet refined brushwork and selective use of gold leaf on halos, motifs, and ritual objects reflect characteristic Goryeo Buddhist painting styles. The rocky landscapes, rendered with empty central spaces for luminous effects, show influence from the *Li-Guo school* (李郭派), offering insights into Goryeo landscape painting trends. Inscriptions on each panel specify the arhat’s order and name, alongside historical details about patronage and purpose, making this set a critical resource for studying Goryeo Buddhist art.\"\n}",

This chapter depicts the 28th stage of Sudhana's pilgrimage, where he visits Avalokitesvara to seek teachings on the bodhisattva path. The painting dramatically illustrates this narrative, focusing on the two central figures: Avalokitesvara and Sudhana. At the center of the composition, Avalokitesvara is depicted in a half-seated posture on a rocky throne at Mount Potalaka (補陀落迦山), rendered with overwhelming grandeur. In the lower right, Sudhana is shown kneeling with joined hands, humbly asking about the bodhisattva path, creating a profound spatial contrast between the two figures. The arrangement and depiction of motifs such as blue bamboo, rocks, and a vase reflect the archetypal style of late Goryeo Water-Moon Avalokitesvara paintings. The figure's form, composition, and meticulous balance exemplify the sophistication of Goryeo Buddhist art. The brushwork skillfully combines thick and thin lines, evoking a fluid, elegant rhythm. Despite the intricate patterns adorning the figure's robe, the painting maintains a dignified aura. The harmonious use of red, white, and gold creates a refined elegance without ostentation.

As plain pure white porcelains without any decorative patterns, they were produced at government kilns during the early Joseon period (15th–16th century). High-quality white porcelains from this era are relatively rare compared to later periods, and these jars are particularly notable for their excellent craftsmanship and clear provenance. The excavation site, part of the historic Unjongga (雲從街, 'Street Where Crowds Gather Like Clouds') area in present-day Jongno’s Cheongjin district, revealed urban structures, road layouts, and numerous ceramic artifacts that illuminate daily life in early Joseon. The jars are representative finds from this excavation. Joseon white porcelain jars, alongside plates, bowls, and bottles, were among the most commonly produced ceramic forms throughout the dynasty. Early Joseon jars are broadly categorized into two types: standing jars (ipho, 立壺) with a weight centered on the shoulder and a tall body, and round jars (wonho, 圓壺) with a centrally balanced, rounded silhouette. The three Cheongjin-dong jars exemplify the typical form of early Joseon jars. Their mouths slope outward, a characteristic feature of early Joseon designs, and though no lids were found, they likely had disk-shaped covers. The rarity of early Joseon pure white porcelains, the jars’ refined quality, intact condition, and their clear archaeological context make these three pieces highly significant. They possess sufficient value to warrant designation as a National Designated Cultural Heritage of South Korea.",

      "content_en": "This bronze drum (nako), used alongside Buddhist bells to produce sacred sounds during temple rituals, is estimated to have been crafted after the introduction of Buddhism to Korea. Measuring 31.5 cm in diameter and 10.5 cm in width, it exhibits an even patina of greenish-blue oxidation. Traditionally believed to have been unearthed in Gyeongsangbuk-do, this Unified Silla-period drum has long been recognized as a foundational form of Korean bronze drums. Its surface is divided into three concentric zones—the striking area (dangjwagu), middle zone (junggu), and outer zone (oeggu)—decorated with alternating thick and thin circular bands resembling light waves. This design is thought to visually interpret the description of a golden drum in the 'Dream Vision of the Golden Drum Repentance' chapter of the *Golden Light Sutra*, Vol. 3, which likens the drum to solar radiance. This aesthetic approach became a standard for subsequent Korean bronze drums, underscoring its monumental significance in craft history. Notably, the drum bears an inscription reading 'Hamhyeong 6th Year, Yiyu Month 12, Day 6: Completed for Seongnae Temple's Geumgu (禁口)'—a critical reference for dating Unified Silla metalwork. The year Hamhyeong 6 (865 CE) corresponds to the 5th year of King Gyeongmun's reign. The term 'Seongnae' (成內) is interpreted as an idu (phonetic script) rendering of 'to complete,' while 'Geumgu' denotes the drum's original name. As the oldest surviving bronze drum in Korea, it exemplifies the refined yet understated aesthetic of Unified Silla metalcraft, achieving sophistication without elaborate ornamentation.",

Dating to the 5th–6th century Silla period, they feature a three-part structure typical of the era: a main ring [主環], middle ornament, and finishing decoration. The main ring, designed to hook onto the ear, is thick and robust. The middle section is adorned with a double layer of leaf-shaped ornaments, while the lowest part terminates in a pen-tip-shaped motif. Though the central ring lacks additional decoration, its joints are meticulously crafted to the point of being nearly invisible to the naked eye, showcasing exceptional technical skill. The small bead decorations are also remarkably delicate and ornate. The three-dimensional pen-tip ornament is further embellished with densely attached tiny gold granules on both its inner and outer surfaces, enhancing its visual splendor. These earrings are celebrated as a masterpiece of Silla tomb metalwork, distinguished by their adherence to the Gyeongju-style tagwan-i (circular earring) tradition, superior craftsmanship, and innovative volumetric form of the pen-tip decoration. They serve as critical material for understanding the evolution and artistic advancements of Silla-era jewelry.",

This Shakyamuni Buddha statue, likely from Jasusa or Insa Temple, is a collaborative work by prominent 17th-century sculptors Hyeonjin (玄眞), Suyeon (守衍), Ungwon (應元), and In-gyun (印均), reflecting a synthesis of their distinct styles. The statue assumes a posture slightly leaning forward, with the right hand forming the Earth-Touching Mudra (降魔觸地印) and the left hand resting on the lap. The upper body features a short waist and broad shoulders, while the lower body has elongated legs, characteristic of Hyeonjin’s style. Meanwhile, the square face with a horizontally carved chin, plump cheeks, narrow eyes, aquiline nose, and a subtle smile evoke the aesthetic of Suyeon’s works. In terms of production background and sculptural style, this statue shares close affinities with the Treasure-designated 'Wooden Seated Vairocana Buddha Statue of Jijangam Hermitage, Seoul.' Both statues exhibit robust proportions, formative beauty, and a stately, imposing presence. Though their techniques are restrained and unadorned, they exude dynamic energy and represent the pinnacle of artistic achievement among early 17th-century Buddhist sculptures, underscoring their exceptional artistic value.",

It was created to celebrate the completion of Hoeamsa Temple in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province. According to the painting record (hwigi) written by the prominent 16th-century monk Bowo, 50 gold-pigment paintings (geumnihwa) and 50 polychrome paintings (chaesaekhwa) were produced, depicting all Buddhas and bodhisattvas, including Shakyamuni, Bhaisajyaguru, Maitreya, and Amitabha.

Commissioned by royal decree, the album was compiled by Chief Envoy Hong Gye-hee (1703-1771) and court painter Lee Pil-seong (18th century). It comprises 21 panels depicting key sites visited during the mission, including the former Shenyang Embassy site, Confucian shrines in Beijing (Wenmiao and Iryundang), and the Shanhai Pass area. The album uniquely combines topographical landscapes with architectural diagrams, utilizing both bird's-eye view perspectives (common in Joseon palace paintings) and linear perspective techniques from Qing dynasty gyuhwa (界畫) style. Notable features include vivid use of high-chroma turquoise pigment, arrangement diagrams (baebando) detailing ritual positions, and colophons (balmun) providing historical context. As a rare surviving example of mid-18th century court art, it serves as both an artistic masterpiece and critical historical document reflecting Joseon's diplomatic relations, Confucian rituals, and artistic exchange with Qing China. Its inclusion of King Yeongjo's personal calligraphy and meticulous documentation make it a significant cultural artifact worthy of treasure designation.",

These manuscripts are dispersed across three institutions: the Hangul Society (8 volumes), the Independence Hall of Korea (5 volumes), and a private collection (1 volume). Seized by Japanese police in 1942 as evidence during the 'Chosun Language Society Incident,' they were unexpectedly discovered in a Chosun Transportation warehouse at Gyeongseong Station (now Seoul Station) on September 8, 1945. This recovery became the foundation for the completion of the 6-volume 'Great Dictionary' in 1957. Beyond its linguistic value as the starting point and outcome of efforts to unify Korean spelling, orthography, and standard language, the manuscript holds profound historical significance. It symbolizes the Korean people's dedication to preserving their language and their aspirations for national independence during Japanese colonial rule. As tangible evidence of preparations for independence and a vivid record of linguistic evolution, it underscores how the systematization of the Korean language was achieved through the collective efforts of the Korean people. This makes it a pivotal and symbolic artifact in both Korean cultural history and the history of the independence movement.",

A complete pair (left and right) was discovered in the position where they had been worn by the interred individual, confirming their actual use. These earrings exemplify the typical characteristics of Gaya-era fine ring earrings (細環耳飾). The first segment of the middle ornament features a hollow spherical decoration, while the second segment has a small ring adorned with a heart-shaped (心葉形) motif. The pendant (垂下飾) is distinguished by a three-dimensional sanchija-shaped ornament, reflecting trends common in earrings from the Hapcheon and Changnyeong regions.\n\nNotably, the earrings employ advanced metalworking techniques: granulation (細粒細工技法), in which gold granules are attached for decoration; filigree (細線細工技法), involving the creation of designs with gold wire; and repousse (打出技法), where gold plates are hammered to form raised patterns. These techniques highlight the sophisticated metalcraft of the Gaya period. Dated to the early 6th century, this pair is a representative artifact of Gaya culture in Hapcheon. It holds significant art-historical value as one of the rare Gaya earrings to combine both granulation and repousse techniques. With a clear provenance and well-preserved features, it serves as a crucial reference for comparative studies of Three Kingdoms period metalwork.",

It significantly contributes to the study of Buddhist sculpture from the early to mid-Goryeo period, a field hindered by limited existing research. The Amitabha Buddha Triad, found in the first tier, represents a key example of the iconography popular in the late Goryeo to early Joseon period, featuring Avalokitesvara and Ksitigarbha as attendants. This triad exhibits distinct early Joseon stylistic traits, offering invaluable insights into the Buddhist faith practices of enshrining statues within pagodas and the development of Buddhist sculpture during this era.

      "content_en": "The 'Denny Taegeukgi' is a national flag associated with Owen Nickerson Denny (1838–1900), an American diplomat who served as a foreign affairs advisor to King Gojong. Denny brought the flag to the United States in January 1891 upon his return and it was later donated to South Korea by his descendants in 1981. Currently housed in the National Museum of Korea, the flag is considered a critical artifact for studying the evolution of Korea’s national flag. Academic consensus dates its creation to no later than 1890, the year Denny left Korea. Appointed in 1886 through Li Hongzhang’s recommendation, Denny succeeded Paul Möllendorff as a senior advisor on diplomacy and internal affairs, playing a pivotal role in shaping policies related to foreign relations, law, and economy under King Gojong’s reign. He advocated for Korea’s sovereignty during his four-year tenure. While Korea first adopted a national flag in September 1882 and officially proclaimed its use on March 6, 1883, no physical examples from that era survive, making the 'Denny Taegeukgi' an invaluable primary source. The flag’s construction reflects late 19th-century modernization efforts: it measures approximately 90 cm in width, crafted from wide cotton fabric using a sewing machine—a departure from traditional hand-stitching. The red and blue Taegeuk (yin-yang symbol) and blue trigrams (gwae) were attached by cutting the base fabric and double-stitching the edges, enhancing visibility. These techniques, influenced by Western flag-making methods, highlight the meticulous craftsmanship of early Korean national flags. As the oldest surviving Taegeukgi (182.5 cm in height, 262 cm in width), it symbolizes the Korean Empire’s diplomatic efforts to assert independence and embodies the resilience of Korea’s independence movement during the Japanese occupation.

These newspapers, including 'Warning Statement,' 'Joseon Independence Newspaper,' 'Jayusinjobo (Freedom Morning Bell),' 'Shindaehan (New Great Korea),' and 'Dongnip Sinmun (Independence Newspaper),' were published between June 6 and December 25, 1919. This suggests the Taegukgi was likely created around 1919, during the March 1st Uprising and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Scholars speculate that the flag was hidden by Baek Chowol, a monk at Jinguansa, or a closely associated figure. The flag's most distinctive feature is its anti-Japanese symbolism: a Japanese flag (Nisshōki) overpainted with the Taegeuk (yin-yang) symbol and the four trigrams in ink, embodying resistance against colonial rule. Damage from fire and holes in the upper-left corner indicates it may have been used during protests. As one of the few surviving Taegukgi from 1919, it holds significant historical value. The accompanying newspapers, which include articles and illustrations of the Taegukgi, provide critical context. Notably, they reinterpret the Taegeuk and trigrams not just as cosmic elements but as symbols of 'strength and love' striving for 'freedom and equality.' This Taegukgi is the first of its kind discovered in a Korean Buddhist temple, highlighting the role of religious institutions as bases for independence activities. Its unique composition—painting a Taegukgi over a Japanese flag—makes it the oldest known example of such symbolic resistance, underscoring its profound significance in Korea's independence movement.",

It was relocated in June 1938 to serve as the principal Buddha statue of the newly established headquarters of Korean Buddhism (then Taegosa, now Jogye Temple), symbolizing resistance against Japanese-influenced Buddhism and efforts to restore the autonomy and legitimacy of Korean Buddhism. Historically significant in Korean Buddhist history and art, the statue reflects the aspirations of the Buddhist community during that era. Though its exact creation date is unknown, stylistic analysis links it to 15th-century Tibetan Buddhist sculptures influenced by the Ming Dynasty's Yongle-Shunzhi period. It shares similarities with works such as the 1450 Silver-Gilt Bronze Amitabha Buddha Statue of Tongdosa, the 1451 Bronze Seated Buddha, the 1458 Wooden Amitabha Buddha Statue of Heukseoksa Temple, and the 1466 Wooden Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue of Sangwonsa Temple. The statue's serene expression, right-shoulder-bared robe (pyeondanu-gwan), balanced proportions, dynamic drapery, and refined craftsmanship rival the artistic mastery of the National Treasure 'Wooden Seated Maitreya Bodhisattva Statue of Sangwonsa Temple, Pyeongchang.'",

      "content_en": "The 'Angbu Ilgu (仰釜日晷)' or 'Angbu Ilyeong (仰釜日影),' meaning a sundial shaped like a pot facing the sky, was first created in 1434 (16th year of King Sejong's reign) by Jang Yeong-sil (蔣英實), Lee Cheon (李蕆), and Lee Sunji (李純之) under royal command. Installed at Jongmyo Shrine and Hyejeonggyo Bridge in October of the same year, it was widely distributed in palaces and government offices in various forms until the late Joseon period. No examples from the early Joseon era survive today. The extant Angbu Ilgu, inscribed with the latitude '37 degrees 39 minutes 15 seconds North (北極高三十七度三十九分一十五秒)' using silver inlay on the north (子) direction, is confirmed through the 『Gukjo Yeoksanggo (國朝曆象考)』 to have been first used after 1713 (39th year of King Sukjong's reign), suggesting its production date is post-1713. Approximately 10 Angbu Ilgu examples remain in Korea, with three (housed at the National Palace Museum, Gyeongju National Museum, and Sungshin Women’s University Museum) designated as Treasures. These three share nearly identical materials, dimensions, forms, techniques, and functions, indicating they may have been crafted by the same artisan. The Gyeongju National Museum’s Angbu Ilgu was acquired during the Japanese colonial period. Structurally, it comprises a hemispherical sundial (resembling a cauldron), a dial plate (시반), horizontal plane (지평면), gnomon (영침), and base. While similar to the National Palace Museum’s example, the Gyeongju piece differs in that its inscriptions are engraved counterclockwise (right to left) instead of clockwise. The dial plate features a gnomon aligned north-south (午子) toward the North Pole, vertical time lines at 15-minute intervals, and 13 horizontal seasonal lines (24 solar terms) in silver inlay. The base consists of four legs with dragon motifs holding celestial pearls, flanked by cloud patterns, and a cross-shaped support ending in turtle heads. Unlike the National Palace Museum’s example, the Gyeongju piece’s cross support lacks stepped tiers and is straight. The three designated Angbu Ilgu exemplars are distinguished by: ① exceptional craftsmanship in silver inlay on time/seasonal lines, riveting/soldering on the gnomon and base, and decorative motifs (dragons, clouds, turtles); ② their rarity as a new decorative style without horizontal grooves (unlike previously designated Treasures); and ③ their scientific and cultural significance as innovative tools reflecting Joseon-era astronomical advancements and humanitarian governance, enabling simultaneous measurement of time and seasonal dates via solar shadows.",

The extant Angbu Ilgu bear an inscription stating 'Polar Altitude 37° 39′ 15″ (北極高三十七度三十九分一十五秒)' engraved in silver inlay on the north (子) direction, a notation first used after 1713 (39th year of King Sukjong's reign), as confirmed by the 『Gukjo Yeoksanggo (國朝曆象考)』.

Approximately 10 Angbu Ilgu are known to exist in Korea, with three—housed at the National Palace Museum, Gyeongju National Museum, and Sungshin Women's University Museum—designated as Treasures. These three share nearly identical materials, dimensions, forms, craftsmanship, and functionality, suggesting they may have been made by the same artisan. The Sungshin Women's University Museum's Angbu Ilgu was acquired by the museum in 1970. Structurally similar to the National Palace Museum and Gyeongju National Museum specimens, it comprises a cauldron-shaped hemispherical dial plate (시반), horizontal plane (지평면), gnomon (영침), and base (받침대). A key difference is the direction of the inscriptions: while the National Palace Museum's example has text engraved clockwise (left to right), the Sungshin and Gyeongju versions follow a counterclockwise (right to left) orientation. The dial plate features a gnomon aligned north-south (午子) toward the North Pole, vertical time lines at 15-minute intervals, and 13 horizontal seasonal lines (24 solar terms) in silver inlay. The base consists of four legs and a cross-shaped support. Each leg is adorned with a dragon holding a wish-granting jewel (여의주) ascending to the sky, flanked by cloud patterns. The ends of the cross-shaped support depict turtle heads with a central hole. The base design of the Sungshin and National Palace Museum specimens includes stepped platforms, differing from the straight-edged Gyeongju example. The three designated Angbu Ilgu are distinguished by: ① exceptional craftsmanship in silver inlay on time and seasonal lines, riveting and soldering techniques on the gnomon and base, and intricate decorative motifs (dragons, clouds, turtle heads); ② their rarity as a new decorative style without horizontal grooves (unlike previously designated Treasures); and ③ their dual functionality in measuring time and seasons, reflecting Joseon's astronomical advancements and the monarchy's benevolent governance.

Hwadam Sinseon, who succeeded the artistic traditions of Sangyeom, Mingwan, and Yeonheung—prominent painters from the Seoul-Gyeonggi region who led the 1790 Yongjusa Buddhist painting project—is regarded as a representative figure of the 19th-century Seoul School of Painting (京城畵派). This Gwaebul was commissioned to pray for the longevity of King Sunjo (r. 1800–1834), Queen Sunjeong, the consort of Crown Prince Hyomyeong, the royal concubine, and the heir (later King Heonjong). Notable patrons included Kim Jo-sun (金祖淳, 1765–1832), King Sunjo's father-in-law; Sukseon Ongju (淑善翁主), a daughter of King Jeongjo, and her consort; and King Sunjo's daughters—Princesses Myeongon (明溫公主), Bok-on (福溫公主), and Deokon (德溫公主)—along with their consorts and court ladies. A distinctive feature of this Gwaebul lies in its iconography: it introduces a variation in the triad composition by depicting Rosana Buddha in the form of a Tathagata, combines the disciples Mahakasyapa and Ananda with the bodhisattvas Manjusri and Samantabhadra, and arranges the 'Buddha-Disciples-Bodhisattvas' in upper, middle, and lower registers—a layout that significantly influenced later Gwaebuls in the Seoul-Gyeonggi region from the late 19th to early 20th century. Beyond its iconographic innovations, the painting exhibits refined aesthetics through its serene and dignified depiction of figures, precise and robust brushwork, vivid and bright color palette, and intricate patterns. Additionally, it retains its original ceremonial garments (복장물) and a custom-made case, both accompanied by historical records such as the painting inscription (화기).",

The bell’s design, featuring 11 deities (Five Wisdom Kings, Brahma, Indra, and the Four Heavenly Kings), is a rare example of Esoteric Buddhist iconography in Korean metalwork.\n\nThese artifacts are significant for their reflection of Goryeo’s advanced metalworking techniques, Buddhist ritual practices, and the historical connection to Yeongguksa Temple.

This iconography was widely popular in the Seoul-Gyeonggi region during the 18th–19th centuries.

The Saga Study Program, initiated during King Sejong's era, selected young and talented scholars to grant them leave for focused academic study instead of official duties. Though it faced periods of abolition, it was reinstated under King Jungjong. Historical records from the 'Annals of the Joseon Dynasty' and literary collections indicate the gathering depicted in the painting occurred around 1531 (26th year of King Jungjong's reign), with the artwork likely dating to the same period. Preserved as a hanging scroll, this piece exemplifies the typical composition of early Joseon-era gathering paintings. At the top, the title '독서당계회도' is inscribed in seal script. The central scene portrays the natural landscape around Dumopo (豆毛浦), the Reading Hall, and officials enjoying a boat ride on the Han River. The ink-dominated landscape employs single-line-and-dot techniques and brushwork methods characteristic of the An Gyeon school (安堅派), with distant mountains rendered in deep blue using the stone blue pigment, a notable feature. The lower section lists 12 attendees in regular script, detailing their pen names, names, courtesy names, ancestral seats, birth years, Saga Study years, civil service examination results, official ranks and positions at the time of the gathering, and familial relations. The attendees include Jang Ok (張玉), Hong Seo-ju (洪叙疇), Heo Ja (許磁), Im Baek-ryeong (林百齡), Song In-su (宋麟壽), Song Sun (宋純), Ju Se-bung (周世鵬), Lee Rim (李霖), Heo Hang (許沆), Sin Seok-gam (申石澗), Eom Heun (嚴昕), and Choi Yeon (崔演). This painting is the earliest extant example of a Reading Hall gathering painting with a confirmed creation date and excellent preservation. It holds significant historical and art-historical value for reflecting early realistic landscape painting styles of the Han River area, contrasting with the idealized landscapes prevalent in early Joseon.",

      "content_en": "The 'Gilded Bronze Amitabha Buddha Triad and Enshrined Relics' is a Buddhist sculpture ensemble confirmed through a votive document to have been created in 1333 (2nd year of King Chungsuk's reign). It comprises the central Amitabha Buddha flanked by Avalokitesvara (Gwan-eum) and Mahasthamaprapta (Daeseongji) Bodhisattvas. This triad exemplifies the typical characteristics of 14th-century Goryeo Buddhist sculptures and holds significant importance in Korean Buddhist art history as a benchmark for iconography and stylistic analysis.\n\nThe sculptures display distinctive features of the era, including aristocratic facial proportions, elegant forms, circular chest medallions, elevated ushnisha (symbolic crown protuberance), flowing bodily contours, and meticulously crafted floral crowns with layered petals. These elements, along with intricate casting techniques and metalwork, reflect the artistic and technical achievements of the period.\n\nNotably, the composition combines a seated main Buddha with standing attendant bodhisattvas, a format not previously documented. The enshrined relics include a dated votive document, dharani scrolls with donor names, a sealed wooden plaque inscribed with 'Gwan (Observation),' and a dharani scroll bearing the seal and handwriting of Lady Kwon of Yeongga-gun. These artifacts reveal the identities of key figures involved in the creation, such as patrons Jang Hyun and his wife Lady Seon, supervisor Haeng-in, and primary contributors Oh-hoe and Kim Jin, a high-ranking official who participated in significant Buddhist rituals for the Yuan dynasty's empress dowager. The triad's intact preservation as originally consecrated further enhances its historical and scholarly value, offering critical insights into late Goryeo Buddhist sculpture production.",

These artifacts were employed to confer titles such as queen, crown prince, and crown princess, or to bestow honorific names (尊號), posthumous titles (諡號), temple names (廟號), and epithets (徽號) upon kings, queens, retired kings (上王), queens dowager, and grand queens dowager. The 'Royal Seals' (御寶) are ceremonial seals crafted during enthronement or title-conferring ceremonies, while the 'Investiture Documents' (御冊) are inscribed texts detailing the historical context, significance, and content of the rituals. Seals were categorized by status and material into golden seals (金寶), jade seals (玉寶), and silver seals (銀印), while documents were classified as jade tablets (玉冊), bamboo tablets (竹冊), and gold tablets (金冊). The 'Edicts' (敎命) are instructive texts issued during ceremonies such as the crown prince's coming-of-age ritual (冠禮) or the enthronement of queens and princes, emphasizing the dignity of the position and admonishing the recipients to fulfill their duties. These artifacts were enshrined in the Jongmyo Shrine, comprising 19 main halls (正殿) and 16 auxiliary halls (永寧殿).

The designation criteria exclude items created during the Japanese colonial period (post-1910) and focus solely on artifacts enshrined in Jongmyo for kings, queens, and their consorts. The collection holds national treasure status due to its unique representation of Joseon's royal culture, academic value linked to historical records like the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, artistic excellence by master craftsmen, embodiment of Confucian ideals, and UNESCO Memory of the World registration in 2017 as 'Royal Seal and Investiture Booklets of the Joseon Dynasty.'",

It was written for his six-year-old grandson, Lee Si-jung (1602–1657), the eldest son of his eldest son, Lee Seong-nam (1578–1642), to aid in his education. The Thousand Characters Classic, originally composed by Zhou Xing-si of the Chinese Liang dynasty, was widely used in Korea as a foundational text for learning Chinese characters, though the exact date of its introduction to Korea remains unclear. This manuscript comprises 126 pages: 125 pages of main text and 1 page of colophon. The cover is made of laminated paper coated with beeswax, with the title 'Thousand Characters Classic' inscribed in ink. On the reverse of the front cover, two white seal impressions read 'Cheongheon' (the pen name of Lee Gyeong-il, Lee Hang-bok's 6th-generation descendant, 1734–1820) and 'Wolseong Segah' (referring to the Moonseong Lee clan). The main text features 8 characters per page (2 lines of 4 characters each) across 125 pages, totaling 1,000 characters. The script is Regular Script with influences from the Song Xue style, blended with Running Script elements and variant characters. Hangeul annotations indicating pronunciation and meaning are added beneath each Chinese character, likely by a later scribe. The colophon at the end, written in semi-cursive script by Lee Hang-bok, states: 'Early summer of the Jeongmi year (1607), written for my grandson Si-jung. A fifty-year-old man, sweating and enduring hardship to write—do not discard this and betray my intent.' This colophon confirms the creator and date of production, highlighting Lee Hang-bok's dedication to his descendants' education. As the earliest extant handwritten Thousand Characters Classic and the largest-known manuscript of its kind (with characters approximately 8 cm in size), it holds significant value in the history of calligraphy. Additionally, the Hangeul annotations provide critical material for studying the evolution of the Korean language during this period.",

Built upon his family's eight-generation collection and enriched by his discerning eye, it encompasses 1,136 works by 600 individuals spanning approximately 600 years, from Jeong Mong-ju (1337–1392) to Lee Do-young (1884–1933). The collection comprises 34 bound volumes and one thread-bound catalog. Each volume features calligraphic pieces arranged according to size, with annotations on the right margin detailing the writer's name, lifespan, and other information. The first volume bears the seal-script title 'Geunmuk' (槿墨) alongside the phrase 'Eighty Reeds' (八十葦), accompanied by seals: a round 'Jinjueom-in' (眞住庵印) at the top right, and square red and white seals reading 'Sechang's Treasure' (世昌之鉩) and 'Weichang's Calligraphic Ink' (葦蒼翰墨) below. The catalog records writers' names, pen names, origins, eras, professions, and lineages. 'Geunmuk' covers a wide temporal range from late Goryeo to the Japanese colonial period, including works by kings, commoners, monks, and middle-class scholars. It encompasses nearly all genres of classical Chinese literature, with a dominant focus on letters, offering critical insights into socioeconomic conditions, daily life, and historical contexts. As a comprehensive compilation of renowned calligraphers' works, it illuminates evolving stylistic trends across periods, making it an invaluable resource for Korean calligraphic history. While most pieces are original, some attributed works (e.g., by Prince Anpyeong and Hwang Hui) retain scholarly value for their stylistic representation. Regarded as the most outstanding calligraphic anthology in both quantity and quality, 'Geunmuk' stands as a pivotal reference in Korean art history.",

The bodhisattva is depicted wearing an elaborate jeweled crown and seated with hands forming the Dharmachakra Mudra (Teaching Gesture). The craftsmanship employs the dry-lacquer technique (geonchil), which involves coating a clay mold with multiple layers of hemp cloth and lacquer, then removing the clay core. The oldest surviving dry-lacquer Buddhist statue in Korea is the 'Dry-Lacquer Seated Bhaisajyaguru Buddha at Cheongnyangsa Temple, Bonghwa' (late Silla to early Goryeo), followed by the 'Dry-Lacquer Seated Monk Hee-rang at Haeinsa Temple, Hapcheon' (early 10th century). With only around 20 extant dry-lacquer statues, this technique holds significant rarity in Korean Buddhist sculpture history. This particular statue stands 124.5 cm tall, characterized by its solemn yet intricately decorated appearance. It exhibits balanced proportions, a robust physique, voluminous hands emphasizing realism, hair elegantly braided and cascading over the shoulders, and stone-inlaid eyes. The meticulous details contrast with the statue's dignified facial expression and broad shoulders, creating a majestic beauty. The National Museum of Korea's 'Dry-Lacquer Seated Bodhisattva' retains its original form with minimal later repairs, making it the largest and most imposing extant dry-lacquer bodhisattva statue.

The materials were primarily compiled around the 1760s, with household and land tax data aligned with the 1759 (35th year of Yeongjo) 'Gihae Census.' Comprising 55 volumes, it includes 295 county records (eupji), 17 camp records (yeongji), and 1 military post record (jinji). Each volume features the title 'Yeojidoseo' and listed counties on the cover, with maps and geographical descriptions in the main text. Unlike earlier records, Yeojidoseo uniquely prefaced each county entry with a map. These hand-colored maps, spanning one or two pages, include provincial maps of six regions (excluding Gyeonggi and Jeolla), 12 camp/military maps, and 296 county maps.

These intricate designs exemplify the 'se-mil-ga-gwi' (delicately exquisite) quality of Goryeo najeon described in the 12th-century text *Song Hui-gao Li Dao-ying's Illustrated Account of Goryeo*.\n\nMeasuring 18.5 cm in height, 33.0 cm in width, and 19.4 cm in total height, it is smaller than typical Goryeo lacquerware scripture boxes. Only about 20 Goryeo najeon boxes survive worldwide, making this example particularly notable for its internal partitions—a feature unseen in other extant pieces. Traces of removed hinges or metal nails on the front, back, and sides suggest it was repurposed from a larger box. The piece is celebrated for its exceptional preservation, vibrant mother-of-pearl hues, and meticulous craftsmanship, embodying the technical, artistic, and scholarly achievements of late Goryeo lacquerware.",

      "content_en": "The Folding Screen of Seowon Ajip by Kim Hong-do is a six-panel work painted in 1778 (2nd year of King Jeongjo's reign in Joseon) by the renowned artist Kim Hong-do. It depicts the 'Seowon Ajip' (Scholarly Gathering in the Western Garden), a literary and artistic assembly held around 1087 in the western garden of Wang Xian, a son-in-law of Emperor Yingzong of the Northern Song dynasty. The gathering featured prominent figures such as Su Shi, Li Gonglin, and Mi Fu. While the composition borrows iconography from Ming dynasty artist Qiu Ying, Kim Hong-do infused the scene with dynamic vitality through bold brushstrokes rendering willows, rocks, and pines, and added auspicious motifs like deer and cranes, reinterpreting the theme in a distinctly Joseon style.\n\nThe six panels arrange key figures across panels 3 to 6: Li Gonglin painting *Gwihoe Gyeran Do* (Returning to the Countryside), Su Shi composing poetry, and Monk Wontong engaged in discourse. Panels 5 and 6 feature a 14-line colophon by Kim's teacher Kang Se-hwang, dated December 1778—three months after the work's completion in September 1778. Kang praises Kim as 'Shinpil' (Divine Brush), offering critical insight into Kim's artistic philosophy.\n\nThis screen is a seminal work representing Joseon's late 18th-century scholarly gathering culture (*ahoe munhwa*) and a key example of Kim Hong-do's style at age 34. As a dated work (*ginyeonjak*), it holds significant art-historical value and established a new model for subsequent *Seowon Ajip* folding screens. It exemplifies Joseon painting's creativity in adapting Chinese themes, underscoring the dynasty's artistic independence and historical legacy.",

Commissioned for Daljun (達夋), the artwork features orchids delicately outlined in light ink at the center, surrounded by four poetic inscriptions (題詩) and dedicatory texts (題辭) that reflect exceptional literary and aesthetic refinement.

It is also historically significant as a site where monks actively participated in defending against Japanese invasions. During a 1993 precision survey by the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, an inscription on the main ridge beam (jongdori) of the Daeungjeon Hall revealed that the hall was consecrated in 1658 (the 9th year of King Hyojong’s reign).

It emphasizes the universal accessibility of Buddhahood as its core philosophy. Originating in northwestern India around the time of Christ, the sutra underwent two expansions. In Korea, the eight-volume translation by Kumārajīva (鳩摩羅什) was most widely disseminated, with Chapter 25, the 'Universal Gateway of Avalokiteśvara' (觀世音菩薩普門品), serving as a key scriptural basis for Avalokiteśvara (Guan Yin) devotion. Central to the sutra is the concept of 'Hoesam Gwuil' (會三歸一), which posits that the Three Vehicles (三乘) ultimately converge into the One Vehicle (一乘), affirming that all teachings are skillful means leading to enlightenment and that the path to Buddhahood is open to all. Historical records, including the Samguk Yusa (三國遺事) and Uicheon's (義天) Newly Compiled Catalogue of the Teaching Treasury (新編諸宗敎藏總錄), confirm its circulation since the Three Kingdoms period.

However, its effectiveness was severely limited in rainy, snowy, or windy conditions, and its short barrel made it unsuitable for long-range combat.

Measuring 24.5 cm in height and 14.4 cm in width, the colophon at the end reveals that the original Goryeo-era woodblocks had deteriorated over time, necessitating the creation of new blocks. King Taejo had previously designated the Lotus Sutra, Silver Mirror Sutra, and Long Life Sutra as texts beneficial to the world, commissioning the carving of the first two in 1398 (7th year of his reign). The Long Life Sutra was not recarved then due to the existence of Goryeo blocks, but by 1416, their poor condition prompted the production of this new edition.

      "content_en": "This portrait depicts Yeongseong-gun Park Mun-su (1691–1756), a prominent figure often symbolizing the role of a royal inspector (御使) during the Joseon Dynasty. While Park received a full-length and half-length portrait as a Bunmu Gongsin (奮武功臣, Meritorious Subject of Martial Valor) in 1728 at age 38—both designated as Treasures in 1994—this half-length portrait differs significantly. Unlike the earlier works, it shows Park in old age wearing a xidi (犀帶, rhinoceros hide belt) befitting a first-rank official, rather than the hakjeong geumdae (鶴頂金帶, golden crane-topped belt) of his youth. This suggests it was commissioned later, likely in 1751, when Jo Hyeon-myeong (趙顯命), another Bunmu Gongsin, organized the creation of half-length portraits of 14 surviving meritorious subjects for the Hunbu Hwasangcheop (勳府畵像帖, Album of Meritorious Portraits). Historical records from the Guinokjip (歸鹿集) confirm that Park, then 61 and a first-rank official, was among those who posed anew, while others used existing portraits. This work thus holds exceptional importance in the study of Joseon portraiture and the iconography of meritorious subjects.

The painting technique employs diluted yellow ochre for flesh tones, ink outlines, indigo for hair, and green for eyebrows. Unlike 16th-century Buddhist paintings that used gold lines, this work utilizes white and yellow ochre, with the inscription hastily written in ink—a stark contrast to formal court-commissioned pieces.\n\nDated to 1565, it is one of only three to four extant early Joseon Buddhist paintings (with one nationally designated), and the largest in scale. As the oldest surviving example of white and yellow ochre linework, it provides critical insight into the diversity of Buddhist painting styles during the mid-Joseon period, distinct from court-influenced works.",

Notably, circular stone pillars support the lower halves of the outer columns—a regional adaptation to frequent typhoons and heavy rainfall, also seen in structures like Beomeosa Temple's Daeungjeon and Iljumun in Dongnae, Busan.\n\nThe interior employs a one-inner-column five-beam system (1-goju ob-ryangga), while the sides use a two-inner-column five-beam system (2-goju ob-ryangga). The rear bracket system (gongpo) exhibits simpler bracketing (salmi) and joinery characteristic of mid-Joseon architecture, similar to Yangsan Sinheungsa Temple's Daegwangjeon and Beomeosa Temple's Daeungjeon. In contrast, the front bracket system was later embellished with ornate decorative elements, reflecting transitional influences from the multi-bracket system (dapo), akin to Dongnae Hyanggyo's Banhwaru and Beomeosa Temple's Jongnu. A unique architectural feature is the placement of the primary bracket (choikong) atop the cap block (juju), diverging from the typical placement below.\n\nThe two mukseongi inscriptions provide critical historical and architectural data, solidifying the hall's status as the oldest surviving wooden structure in Busan. Though windows, ceilings, and dancheong (decorative paintwork) have been renewed, the core structure retains its original 1655 form and 1771 renovations. Four murals, including a bamboo painting (mukjukdo), are presumed to date to the founding or 18th-century repairs, further attesting to its historical continuity.

Comprising a vertical long-plate helmet (縱長板冑), neck guard (頸甲), and vertical long-plate armor (縱長板甲), this is the only complete set of its kind discovered to date. With a clear provenance and distinct production period, it serves as a critical benchmark for dating armor from the Three Kingdoms period. Despite the typical corrosion issues of iron artifacts, this set is exceptionally well-preserved, offering invaluable insights into the structural composition of Gaya iron armor. The armor was crafted by hammering iron plates into thin, elongated forms and connecting them with leather through perforated holes, allowing flexibility to conform to the body's contours. Traces of repairs indicate practical use by Gaya soldiers, providing a vivid glimpse into their military life. As a representative cultural heritage of Gaya's iron culture, this artifact holds significant historical value for its clarity of origin and comprehensive demonstration of Gaya armor-making techniques.",

While bronze bells used in rituals during the Ancient Joseon period, such as the Paldu-ryeong (Eight-headed Bell) and Ssangdu-ryeong (Double-headed Bell), have been documented, no examples from the Three Kingdoms period were previously discovered. This artifact is uniquely significant as it demonstrates the continuation of related religious beliefs and ritual practices into the Gaya period. Dated to the 4th–5th century, it is believed to have been used by high-ranking Gaya leaders. The bell was hollow-cast by pouring molten bronze into molds for both the body and the bells, with a wooden handle inserted into the round body's grip. Its smoothly finished surface highlights advanced technical achievements in metalworking. As a one-of-a-kind artifact in East Asia, it symbolizes Gaya's ritual culture and bronze craftsmanship, holding immense cultural and historical value.",

The event is documented in the Annals of King Seonjo, which records that officials Lee Hang-bok and Yu Yeong-gyeong submitted a memorial thanking the king for the royal wine granted during the banquet. The old merit subjects included 42 Guangguk (光國) and Pingnan (平難) Merit Subjects, recognized for correcting historical records about King Taejo's lineage and suppressing a rebellion led by Jeong Yeo-rip, respectively. The new merit subjects comprised 109 Hoseong (扈聖), Seongmu (宣武), and Cheongnan (淸難) Merit Subjects, honored for their roles in the Imjin War, the Japanese invasions of 1592–1598, and the suppression of a revolt by Lee Mong-hak.

The artwork employs a bird’s-eye view with minimalist line drawings, characteristic of 17th-century Korean record paintings. Seasonal details, such as snow-covered mountains and bare branches, reflect the November setting.

It depicts villages and military strongholds in the Gwanbuk region (modern-day North Hamgyong Province) during the Joseon Dynasty. Each page features detailed pictorial representations of geography, with marginal notes on distances from Hanyang (present-day Seoul), household populations, military personnel numbers, and post stations (yeokwon).

A distinctive feature of this map is its use of solid lines to directly illustrate communication routes between beacon stations (bongsu), a novel approach not found in other regional maps. Additionally, it enhances usability by specifying distances between beacons. The vibrant color palette, texture techniques (junbeop) for mountainous terrain, and wave patterns in rivers reflect the high artistic standards of court painters from the Royal Painting School (Dohwaseo). As the most complete and well-preserved military-administrative map of the northern frontier, it exemplifies the evolution of Joseon cartography through its detailed records of beacon networks, inter-beacon distances, and signal protocols.

The bronze drum housed at Gukcheongsa Temple, cast in 1666, holds significant value due to its rarity as a 17th-century artifact—produced just 20 years after the Treasure-designated drum at Eunhaesa Temple. With a diameter of 40.5 cm, it is classified as medium-sized and follows the standard form: the sides fold backward to create a short rim, and a wide sound hole is perforated on the reverse. The drum's face (고면) is divided into two concentric circles. The central area (당좌구) features an undecorated small aperture, while the middle zone (중구) is adorned with a circular Sanskrit inscription of five of the six characters from the Light Mantra (광명진언). This reduction in the number of mantra characters reflects a transitional style between Goryeo and Joseon periods, also observed in contemporary bronze bells. The outermost section displays a single-line lotus scroll pattern (연당초문), a motif unique to late Goryeo drums and absent in later Joseon examples.  \n\nThree semicircular rings are attached to the sides. Unlike typical drums, which bear inscriptions on the sides, this drum has a raised inscription (양각) on the reverse. The inscription reads: 'Cast in the 5th year of Kangxi (1666) for Jangcheonsa Temple on Yeonhwasan Mountain, Gyeongju, Gyeongsangdo, weighing 100 geun. Donors: Park Chung-min, Lee Mak-nam. Craftsmen: Daejang Tae-eung, Shin-yeol, Yeong-deuk. Temple supervisors: Gye-ho, Seol-eon, Seol-am, Seol-sim.'  \n\nThe drum's inscription provides critical historical data, including the names of artisans like Daejang Tae-eung, whose work is otherwise undocumented in Joseon metalcraft. Though its design is relatively simple, the drum's 17th-century provenance, unique inscription placement, and association with previously unknown artisan Tae-eung make it a vital resource for studying Joseon-era casting techniques and artisan networks. Alongside the Eunhaesa Temple drum, it stands as an indispensable reference for research on Joseon bronze drums.\"\n}",

Despite these features, its texture closely resembles Goryeo celadon, suggesting an early Joseon origin.\n\nThe design includes a bead-shaped band beneath the mouth, small stamped chrysanthemums on the shoulders framed by an inlaid lotus border, and diamond-shaped floral motifs with black-and-white inlaid lotuses on the flattened front and back. The sides feature chrysanthemum patterns with black-inlaid vine designs, while the base displays an inlaid lotus and a bead-shaped band around the foot. Notably, the vine patterns on the body and the lotus border on the shoulders retain the original clay color, creating visual contrast. The high foot provides stability, and the proportions of each section harmonize elegantly.",

The eaves mimic wooden architecture with intricate double-layered rafter patterns. A lotus band encircles the upper surface, supporting a finial base (noban) carved with mythical Kalavinka birds, symbolic of Buddhist paradise. Although partially damaged, the stupa exhibits harmonious proportions and exceptional craftsmanship, reflecting distinct characteristics of the Goryeo period.

Comprising 139 volumes—46 volumes of *Sega* (世家, annals of kings), 50 volumes of *Yeoljeon* (列傳, biographies), 39 volumes of *Ji* (志, treatises), 2 volumes of *Yeonpyo* (年表, chronological tables), and 2 volumes of *Mokchok* (目錄, catalog)—it stands alongside the *Samguk Sagi* (『三國史記』) as one of Korea’s two great official histories. Despite being compiled during the early Joseon period, it retains high objectivity and reliability by incorporating original Goryeo-era sources, making it an indispensable resource for understanding Goryeo’s history, culture, and institutions.  \n\nEarlier attempts to compile Goryeo’s history by scholars like Lee Je-hyeon (李齊賢) and An Chuk (安軸) in the late Goryeo period and by Jeong Do-jeon (鄭道傳) under King Taejo of Joseon remained unfinished. The current version was finalized after multiple revisions under King Sejong, beginning in 1449 and completed in 1451. Printed in 1455 using *Eulhae* metal type (乙亥字), later woodblock editions were produced in 1482 (King Seongjong), 1613 (King Gwanghae), and the 17th–18th centuries.  \n\nThe Dong-A University Seokdang Museum’s copy, designated as Treasure No. 2021-6, is a 75-book woodblock edition (139 volumes) based on the *Eulhae* metal type.

Notable features include a binding error in volumes 39–40 of Book 21 and the presence of a seal belonging to Hong Jin (洪進, 1541–1616), indicating it was part of his collection. Measuring 27.5×18.3 cm, it is the smallest known edition, reflecting differences between early and later printings.

At the center, Shakyamuni sits in a meditative posture on a lotus throne, adorned with a floral mandorla.

The octagonal main body of the stupa is inscribed with 'Bogak국사 Jeongjo Stupa' on the front, a door-shaped carving on the back, and the Four Heavenly Kings and a Bodhisattva standing on a lotus throne on the remaining six sides.

The collection begins with a preface by Seo Geo-jeong and a biographical sketch of the author written by Seong Hyeon. Volumes 1–3 contain poems, while Volume 4 includes 13 prose pieces such as rhyme-prose (bu), prefaces (seo), records (gi), essays (seol), postscripts to books (seohu), biographies (jeon), and petitions (jeon). A postscript dated 1458 by the author’s friend Lee Seung-so concludes the work. Notably, the collection features correspondence with prominent figures of the era, including Kang Hui-meng, Kim Su-on, Kim Su-nyeong, No Sasin, Seo Geo-jeong, Lee Seung-so, Im Won-jun, and Lee Pa, offering critical insights into the literary and intellectual circles of early Joseon.

This follows the typical 17th-century Gongsin portrait format. Notably, the peacock breastplate (공작흉배) and rhinoceros leather belt (犀帶) do not align with his rank at the time of his Gongsin designation, suggesting the portrait was created posthumously after his reinstatement in 1629—when his son Yun Hyu petitioned for his restoration and he was posthumously promoted to Prime Minister (영의정).

Despite severe flaking and loss of pigment, the work showcases Uigyun's mastery through delicate iron-wire-line (鐵線描) facial rendering, balanced proportions, nuanced expressions, and subtle tinted coloration. Unlike conventional compositions that unite all figures in a single panel, this painting separates Amitabha Buddha and the Eight Great Bodhisattvas in the central panel, while the left and right panels respectively feature arhats, Brahman and Indra, and the Four Heavenly Kings. This division distinguishes the Buddha's teaching scene from the guardian deities. As the oldest surviving work by Uigyun—a prominent painter active in the Palgongsan region from the late 17th to early 18th century—it provides critical insight into his early artistic style.",

The wide, slightly opened beak allows for pouring, while the legs are connected at the rear to serve as a handle. The lid's lotus seedpod design and structural elements reflect innovative and systematic craftsmanship.

Traces of refractory clay supports, containing coarse black-brown particles, are visible on the unglazed base and around the footrim, where the glaze was deliberately removed. The thin greenish glaze layer reveals a pale bluish-gray body beneath, characteristic of top-grade celadon. Incised, raised, and black-and-white inlay techniques skillfully depict the duck's feather textures. This ewer is a rare and exceptional example of Goryeo celadon (12th century), distinguished by its bold duck motif, intricate decorative patterns, and refined use of jade-green glaze and high-quality clay.

The hall was rebuilt in 1725, and the triad—representing the past, present, and future Buddhas—was consecrated in 1727 (3rd year of King Yeongjo’s reign). The sutras were enshrined during the statue’s creation, with their origins documented in votive texts recovered from each Buddha. Among the triad, the Bhaisajyaguru Buddha contained the most sutras (32 types), including works dated between 1417 (17th year of King Taejong) and 1725. Undated texts are largely attributed to the Goryeo to early Joseon periods, predating the statue’s creation.\n\nNotable items include:\n- **Lotus Sutra (Volumes 4–7)**: Printed in 1417 by Lady Park of Hamyang and others for memorial rites for their deceased parents. The illustrated frontispiece includes a colophon detailing how Madame Jeong commissioned an artist to create and carve the image to pray for her late husband Wang’s rebirth in a pure land. This provides critical insight into early Joseon Buddhist devotion and bibliography.\n- **Ksitigarbha Sutra**: Printed in 1481 (12th year of King Seongjong) from woodblocks carved at Gwansseongsa Temple in 1474. One of seven copies commissioned by Queen Dowager Han (widow of King Yeongjong) for her grandmother’s memorial rites. Its clear publication date, purpose, and quantity make it vital for studying early Joseon Buddhist publishing.\n- **Avatamsaka Sutra (Volumes 1, 25, 63)**: Printed from 12th–13th-century Haeinsa Temple woodblocks, which served as the base text for the Tripitaka Koreana. The folded accordion format (24 lines, 17 characters per line) reflects early Goryeo printing techniques.\n- **Silver-Ink Sutras on Oak Paper**: The *Paramita Sutra* (Volume 2) and *Mahabodhivrata Sutra* (Volume 94), both transcribed in silver ink on oak paper in the 14th century, offer key resources for studying late Goryeo Buddhist manuscript traditions.",

Delicate, fine lines define facial features and drapery, with white outlines emphasizing key contours.\n\nThis painting is significant for its confirmed creation date, detailed records of participating artists, and its role in illustrating the stylistic characteristics of early 18th-century *Jijang Sigwangdo* paintings and the artistic traditions of Gyeongbuk Province's inland monk-artists.",

The inscription notes that it was commissioned in the 6th year of the Qianlong era (1741) for the 'Yumyeonghoe' (幽冥會, Assembly of the Underworld) and originally enshrined at Muryangsujeon Hall of Namjangsa Temple. This confirms the painting's original location and the historical use of the term 'Yumyeonghoe' for Jijang Ten Kings paintings. At Namjangsa Temple, other works by the same artists from the same period—Amitabha Assembly Painting and Samjang Bosaldo (Painting of the Three Realms Bodhisattvas)—survive, suggesting this Jijang Ten Kings Painting was part of a contemporaneous set. The work exemplifies Se-gwan's distinctive style: a dominant palette of green and red, refined brushwork, stable figure proportions, delicately curved eyebrows, small eyes, and sunken mouths. Created earlier than Se-gwan's renowned Jikjisa Samsesebuldo (Triad Buddha Painting, 1744), it is a key example of his artistic evolution. Additionally, the inscription identifies Se-gwan by the epithet 'Yongmyeonsanin' (龍眠山人), offering vital biographical context.",

      "content_en": "The Triad of Bodhisattvas Painting (Samjangbosaldo) from Donghwasa Temple is a ritual Buddhist painting created to guide the souls of the deceased. It depicts Tianzang Bodhisattva (天藏菩薩), Jizi Bodhisattva (持地菩薩), and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva (地藏菩薩). While no examples from the Goryeo period exist, this iconography is exclusively found in Joseon-era works. The composition of such paintings varies: some feature all three figures on a single panel, others span two or three panels. The Donghwasa version is rendered on a single horizontal canvas, encompassing the three bodhisattvas and their attendants.\n\nThe painting’s inscription reveals that the chief painter was Uigyun (義均), a prominent monk-artist of the early 18th century. Records indicate he also produced other works, including triad paintings at Geodongsa Naewonam Temple, a Sweet Dew Buddha Painting at Sinnyeong Sudosa Temple, a Buddhist underworld painting (likely a Ksitigarbha and Ten Kings painting) at Unmunsa Cheongnyeonam Hermitage, an Amitabha Buddha Painting at Changnyeong Yongheungsa Temple, and a Guanyin Bodhisattva Painting at Yeongjisa Hyangnojeon Hall. This suggests Donghwasa Temple served as a central hub or workshop for artists active in the Palgongsan region during this period.\n\nGiven that most pre-16th-century Triad of Bodhisattvas paintings are housed overseas and even 17th–18th-century examples like the 1699 Seoktapsa and 1707 Pagyesa versions are unlocated, the Donghwasa painting holds significant historical value in Buddhist art history. Artistically, it exhibits refined composition, balanced proportions, meticulous figure details, harmonious contrasts of high-chroma red and green, delicate brushwork, and intricate patterns. The work distinctly reflects Uigyun’s style, active in the late 17th to early 18th century around Palgongsan, making it a key piece for studying his artistic lineage.",

The main hall, Wonjongjeon, was confirmed through a recently discovered beam inscription to have been constructed between 1605 and 1606 during the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nWonjongjeon measures three bays wide and three bays deep, with a wooden floor interior. Its foundation and 'ㄱ'-shaped corner stone techniques resemble those of Buseoksa Temple's Muryangsujeon Hall, suggesting architectural continuity from the Silla period. The altarpod enshrining the Buddha features intricate pierced carvings symbolizing Mount Sumeru, including phoenixes and cranes. These motifs, alongside a vow document found within the Gilt-bronze Seated Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva (Treasure No. 000) and King Yeongjo's ceremonial robe, attest to Pagyesa's role as a royal temple dedicated to the well-being of the nation and the longevity of the royal family. The altarpod is regarded as a masterpiece compared to typical examples.\n\nThe bracket system (gongpo) employs a two-tiered outrigger configuration with ancient-style bracket heads (kong'an), reflecting early architectural practices. All three front bays have windows, while traces of upper lintels and central pillars on the rear side bays suggest former double sliding doors. \n\nWonjongjeon Hall retains characteristic multi-bracket roof-support structures of 17th–18th century architecture while preserving its original Silla-era foundation. Combined with intact royal relics, these features solidify its status as a nationally designated Treasure, embodying historical, architectural, and cultural significance.",

Historical records referring to the former Sumajajeon as 'Gogumdang' (Old Golden Hall) indicate that the original center of Donghwasa Temple was Geumdangam, unlike the current focus on the Daeungjeon area. The designation of Geungnakjeon as Geumdang and Sumajajeon as Gogumdang suggests that the former Geumdang was Sumajajeon, with Geungnakjeon serving as the newly built Geumdang. Notably, the hall preserves the Silla-era foundation and stone bases from the temple's original construction, maintaining the same column spacing without alterations. The wooden superstructure from the early 17th century retains ancient construction techniques, including traditional floor layouts with wooden planks beneath the current flooring.\n\nThe extant wooden architecture is definitively dated to 1622 through historical records, making it one of the earliest post-Imjin War reconstructions in late Joseon Buddhist architecture. While modifications from the Japanese colonial period are evident in eaves, windows, and dancheong (decorative paintwork), the overall structure and design preserve the original 17th-century state. The building's proportions and craftsmanship remain aesthetically refined.\n\nArchitecturally, Geungnakjeon's bracket system (gongpo) and structure are particularly significant. The integration of a 17th-century multi-bracket (dapo) system over ancient column intervals involved precise adjustments to bracket arm lengths, ensuring stylistic unity—a testament to the carpenter's skill. Additionally, the pyramidal treatment of inner and outer bracket ends, paired brackets (byeongcheom) at eave corners, and the use of chunyeo (curved brackets) and seonjayeon (decorative railings) reflect techniques prevalent in the Yeongnam region around Palgongsan during the 17th–18th centuries.

Galhangsa Temple, traditionally attributed to the founding by Monk Seungjeon during the early Unified Silla period, features an inscription on the upper foundation stone of the East Pagoda indicating that the pagodas were erected in 758 CE (17th year of King Gyeongdeok's reign) by Monk Eonjeok and his two sisters. The reliquaries, likely consecrated alongside the pagodas, were found within bronze jars placed in sarira chambers beneath the foundations of both pagodas. The bronze sarira container from the West Pagoda, with its lid and body connected by bronze strings, is significant for its resemblance to linked-urn designs popularized in bone containers from the 9th century onward. The sarira bottles from both pagodas exhibit a harmonious, oval-shaped body and a flared, elongated neck characteristic of East Asian vessels from the 8th century, reflecting contemporary aesthetic trends. Notably, the East Pagoda's bottle features a bamboo-joint neck and petal-shaped base, underscoring the Silla artisans' refined sensibilities. Unlike the gabled reliquary style seen at Geungsa Temple, these reliquaries uniquely enshrine a metal bottle resembling a water pitcher within a jar-shaped outer container. Recent conservation revealed a small metal bottle inscribed with the 'Arya Tara Mantra (Junje Jinyeon Dharani),' providing critical insights into Buddhist practices of the era. The inscribed construction date on the East Pagoda's foundation stone establishes these reliquaries as an absolute reference for studying Unified Silla-period sarira artifacts, justifying their designation as a National Cultural Heritage property.",

It includes annotations by the Tang dynasty monk Fazang (法藏, 643–712). In Korea, this text was traditionally studied as part of the core curriculum (四敎科) in Buddhist colleges, alongside texts like the *Diamond Sutra*, *Avatamsaka Sutra*, and *Śūraṅgama Sutra*. The copy housed at Yongmunsa Temple in Daegu is a single volume (33 leaves) corresponding to the lower section (卷下) of Fazang's three-volume commentary. It was printed in 1461 (7th year of King Sejo's reign) from woodblocks produced by the Gangjeong Dogam (刊經都監), a royal publication office. While other editions of Fazang's commentary exist—such as the 1457 initial woodblock edition (初鑄甲寅字本) and re-carved versions from 1528 and 1572—the 1461 Yongmunsa copy is the only known surviving example from that year.

Rebuilt in 1807, the hall has undergone several repairs, resulting in minor changes in scale but largely retaining its original architectural form. Its bracket system (gongpo) and wooden component processing techniques reflect the construction style of the early 19th century, exemplifying the characteristics of late Joseon-era provincial government architecture. Structurally, it features a concise and well-organized 2-goju 7-ryang roof framework, with a hip-and-gable roof (paljakjib) finished with yangsang ridge decorations and takdu finials, embodying the hierarchical and refined aesthetic of late Joseon official buildings. Historical documents detailing material procurement during the 1807 renovation provide valuable insights into its reconstruction. As a rare surviving example of provincial administrative architecture from the Joseon period, it preserves features such as a rain gauge stand (cheukudae) and flagpole base, offering a glimpse into the spatial organization and operational facilities of the Gamyeong.

A signboard reading 'Palgongsan Donghwasa Bonghwangmun (八公山桐華寺鳳凰門)' hangs at the gate's entrance.\n\nArchitecturally, the gate features a single-bay penta-partite hipped roof (5량가 단칸 팔작지붕) with a daepok-style (다포식) bracket system combining jushimpo (주심포) and juganpo (주간포). Its base structure uniquely integrates an upper slanted beam system (상부사재형) with auxiliary columns (보조기둥형), a rare hybrid form. The auxiliary columns are presumed to have been added between 1920 and 1951. The window frame (창방) arrangement follows a '日'-shaped layout, differing from the typical '口'-shaped configuration seen in pyeongbang (평방).\n\nThe bracket system exhibits regional characteristics with gyoduhyeong (교두형) brackets—simply carved without ornate projections—uniformly applied to both inner and outer sides. The spacing between brackets narrows toward the center. The eaves employ a double-layered design (겹처마) with yeonmok (연목, rafters) and buyeon (부연, secondary rafters).

Although the side facades lack bracket sets, the presence of a horizontal purlin (pyeongbang) and corner brackets (eopo) with protruding ends (jeongakpo) suggests that it was rebuilt using reclaimed materials from a former hip-and-gabled (paljakjip) dapo-style building. This implies the hall was initially built as a hip-and-gabled structure in 1465, partially dismantled after wartime damage, and reassembled in 1702 with reused components.\n\nThe bracket system’s design, characterized by unadorned protruding ends (gyoduhyeong) on both inner and outer sides of the front and rear brackets, aligns with a regional style prevalent in the Yeongnam area around Palgongsan Mountain during the 17th–18th centuries. This indicates the involvement of a localized craftsman lineage active in the region. The roof structure is uniquely engineered: while appearing as a five-bay (oyangga) system with a double rafter layer, it is actually a three-bay (samyangga) framework. The inner king post (naemokdori) is extended inward and supported by a vertical beam (pandae-gong), creating a stable horizontal alignment between the front and rear beams. This innovative technique, absent in other heritage sites, exemplifies the diversity of traditional Korean wooden architecture. Additionally, the retention of an old-style raised beam (sseolhaljang) between the ridge (jongdori) and inner king post further underscores its historical significance.",

Compiled into the *Geumgyejip* (Collected Works of Geumgye) by his 7th-generation descendants over 200 years after his death, the diary also records his intellectual exchanges with Chinese scholars, where he elaborated on Korea's education, civil service exams, military, culture, and customs. This makes it a vital resource for understanding late 16th-century East Asian history and cross-cultural interactions.",

This triad is the second known work attributed to Su-yeon as the chief sculptor (首畵僧).

In contrast, the flanking Amitabha and Bhaisajyaguru statues show slightly less refined craftsmanship in facial details and proportions. Compared to Su-yeon’s earlier work, the Wooden Seated Amitabha Buddha Triad at Bongseosa Temple in Seocheon (1619), this triad demonstrates a more sophisticated sculptural sensibility.  \n\nEach Buddha’s facial expression and robe-folding techniques differ, suggesting the influence of other sculptors involved.

This work represents the earliest known piece among Seoknan's extant oeuvre. Seoknan, a master sculptor, trained under influential figures such as Mu-yeom and In-gyun, and was active for approximately 40 years from the late 17th to early 18th century, primarily in the Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces. His prolific output rivals that of the earlier sculptor Hyeonjin (玄眞), who was active in the first half of the 17th century. Collaborators like Chungok, Mohyeon, Deuk-u, and Chobyeon, who worked with Hyeonjin, later joined Seoknan, making this ensemble pivotal for understanding the formation and evolution of the Seoknan School. The statues, housed in the Myeongbujeon Hall (Hall of the Afterlife), comprise 26 figures, including Ksitigarbha, his attendants Domyeongjonja and Mudokgwiwang, the Ten Kings of Hell, judges, guardians, attendants, and generals. They serve to comfort and judge the deceased. The sculptures exhibit 17th-century stylistic traits: lifelike facial expressions, stable proportions with broad, low knees, and an endearing aesthetic emphasizing rounded faces, prominent noses, and compact forms. While retaining individual artistic nuances, the ensemble also reflects the broader aesthetic trends pursued by late 17th-century sculptors. As the earliest surviving work by Seoknan, it holds significant historical value in tracing the development of Buddhist sculpture during the late Joseon period. The intact condition of all principal statues and their exceptional craftsmanship further establish this group as a representative masterpiece of late 17th-century Myeongbujeon iconography.",

Below the niche, the Twelve Zodiac figures are prominently carved in a circular arrangement. These figures, with animal heads and near-nude human bodies, are rare in the context of reliquary stupas, as the zodiac motifs were traditionally used to protect royal tombs during the Unified Silla period.

While no records of the temple's founding survive, the scale of the site suggests it was once a large Buddhist complex. A legend recounts that during the Imjin War (1592–1598), Japanese forces followed rice-washing water flowing 10 *ri* (approximately 4 km) downstream to locate and burn the temple. The temple site was identified during construction of a protective pavilion for the stele, when inscribed roof tiles were discovered.

The inscription reveals that Hyeono became a monk at age 15 at Bulilsa Temple, later served as abbot of Buseoksa Temple, and passed away at 53 in 1178. King Myeongjong bestowed the title 'State Preceptor' and the posthumous name 'Hyeono,' with his remains cremated on the slopes of Dongrimsan Mountain.

The right statue, the Square-hat Buddha (方笠佛), mirrors the left in form but differs in its clasped hand gesture. Local folklore identifies the Round-hat Buddha as male and the Square-hat Buddha as female, tied to a legend from the Goryeo Dynasty. According to the tale, King Sunjong, childless despite marrying Queen Won Shin, was visited by the queen in a dream where two monks requested food. Upon investigating the reported rock formation at Jangjisan Mountain, the king commissioned the carving of these statues and a temple. A prince, Hansan-hu, was born the same year.

The painting's inscription records its production date, title, and donor information. As one of only six surviving early Joseon-era depictions of Amitabha Buddha with Eight Attendants, it holds significant scholarly value for being the sole extant Korean work with a confirmed creation year. The piece retains elements of late Goryeo Buddhist painting traditions, such as its hemp-cloth base and symmetrical arrangement of eight bodhisattvas—including Avalokiteshvara and Ksitigarbha—flanking the central Amitabha Buddha. Simultaneously, it reflects emerging early Joseon stylistic features: a composition centering the Buddha surrounded by bodhisattvas, simplified color-focused painting techniques devoid of intricate patterns, and distinct iconographic details like the circular mandorla encircling the Buddha's head and torso, a broad rounded ushnisha (symbolizing wisdom), and a crescent-shaped central crest. These characteristics make the painting a critical reference for studying the transition from late Goryeo to early Joseon Buddhist art. Its confirmed 1565 date establishes it as an absolute benchmark for research on 16th-century Joseon Buddhist paintings. Additionally, given that most early Joseon Buddhist paintings are held overseas and domestic examples are exceptionally rare—most of which are nationally designated cultural heritage items—this work merits preservation as a Treasure for its historical and artistic significance.",

The upper surface of the foundation stone is engraved with a lotus pattern. The corner pillars of the lower base, though formalistic, are uniquely adorned with raised wave motifs. A thickly laid upper stone on the lower base enhances the pagoda's stability, while the upper base showcases floral-pillared corners and deeply carved dragon patterns on each side, reflecting the skill of the stonemason.

The white marble used imparts an elegant texture, and the overall structure closely resembles Seoul's Wongaksa Temple Site Ten-story Stone Pagoda (National Treasure).

Originally consisting of five woodblock-printed volumes, its initial publication by Ilyeon remains unconfirmed. A version was printed by his disciple Muguk in the 1310s, though it is unclear whether this was the first or a subsequent edition. Two surviving Joseon-era copies, the Seoknambon and Song'eunbon, are believed to date to the reign of King Jungjong. Designated Treasure No. 419, the Song'eunbon comprises Volumes 3–5 but lacks pages 1–6 of Volume 3 and the final four pages of Volume 5. Originally owned by the late Kwon Deok-gyu, it later passed through Lee In-yeong before entering the collection of Kwak Yeong-dae. The text exhibits uniform characters, precise carving, and aged paper quality, suggesting Joseon-era production, and is considered the finest extant version. The Samguk Yusa serves as a vital repository of myths, legends, and ancient Korean language, providing foundational material for archaeological research, studies of relics and sites, and the analysis of Buddhist art—the dominant form of Korean ancient art. Additionally, the hyangga poems preserved within are regarded as paramount cultural heritage of the Korean people.",

As a temple protected by the royal court in the early Joseon period, it is renowned as the place where Taejo Lee Seong-gye, the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, stayed and meditated in his later years. This stele tower, located on a northern ridge of the temple site alongside the stupas of Jigong and Naong (懶翁), serves as the tomb tower of Muhak Daesa (無學大師). A protective stone balustrade surrounds the tower.\n\nMuhak, who also served as the abbot of Hoeamsa, was a prominent monk active from the late Goryeo to early Joseon periods. He gained fame through his association with Taejo Lee Seong-gye, particularly for interpreting a dream that foretold Lee's rise to kingship and his involvement in the folklore surrounding the relocation of the capital to Hanyang (present-day Seoul).\n\nThe tower's structure features an octagonal base adorned with cloud patterns, atop which rests a platform (基壇) composed of lotus-shaped stones at the bottom and top, with a drum-shaped middle stone carved with distinct floral motifs on each of its eight sides. The tower body (塔身) is round, covered with vivid carvings of dragons and clouds, rendered with lifelike details such as dragon scales and dynamic cloud swirls. The octagonal roof stone mimics wooden architectural elements along its eaves, with a steep slope and slightly uplifted corners. A simple round stone crowns the top.\n\nDating to 1407, as recorded in Muhak's epitaph, this tower exemplifies the grand scale and refined proportions characteristic of early Joseon funerary monuments.",

The text derives from the Analects of Confucius, 'Wei Ling Gong' chapter: 'A man of purpose and benevolence does not seek life at the expense of humanity, but may sacrifice his life to fulfill it (志士仁人, 無求生以害仁, 有殺身以成仁).' The calligraphy exhibits bold, dense strokes with a central-tip technique (中鋒勢), sharp and vigorous endings, and a natural blend of regular and semi-cursive scripts. Compared to other treasured works by Ahn, it shares similarities in brushwork, character structure, and dynamic rhythm. As a symbolic representation of Ahn's legacy as an independence activist and for its distinctive artistic style, historical value, and well-documented provenance, it holds significant merit for designation as a national treasure.",

      "content_en": "The <Portrait of Kim Jung-man (金重萬 肖像)> consists of three portraits depicting Kim Jung-man, a military official from the mid-Joseon period. Kim passed the military examination in 1712 (38th year of King Sukjong's reign) and played a key role in suppressing the 1728 Yi In-jwa Rebellion. He later served as the Naval Commander of Chungcheong Province. The portraits include one large piece (103 cm wide, 170 cm tall) and two smaller ones (29 cm wide, 42.5 cm tall each). The large portrait shows Kim seated on a chair, facing right, with hands clasped inside his sleeves. He wears a black official hat and a dark green robe, with a brownish complexion and distinct facial features and shading. The chest area features a badge (heungbae) with two cranes and gold-decorated belts, indicating his rank as a second-class civil official. The two smaller portraits include a 'merit record album' (gongsin hwachap) with text detailing his achievements on one side and his portrait on the other, and a framed painting. Both smaller works share the same artistic style but differ in their badges: the album depicts a tiger, while the framed portrait shows a crane. Painted in the late Joseon period, these portraits adhere to the conventional format of merit portraits, characterized by high official hats, dark green robes, exaggerated robe folds, tiger-skin-covered chairs, and elevated footrests. They are significant for their artistic and historical value in studying Joseon-era portraiture.",

Ascending the throne at age 8, Heonjong remarried after the death of his first queen, Lady Kim (1828–1843), by appointing Hong Jae-ryong's daughter as his second queen, Hyojong, in October 1844. The screen depicts the ceremonial proceedings held at Changdeokgung Palace’s Injeongjeon Hall, though the actual events occurred at Gyeonghuigung Palace. This discrepancy reflects a 19th-century artistic convention of portraying such ceremonies at Changdeokgung regardless of the actual venue.  \n\nPanel 1 features a text composed by Jo Byeong-gu (1801–1845), a senior scholar of the Hall of Literary Merit. Panels 2–7 illustrate the grand ceremony with meticulous detail: officials, palatial structures, landscapes, and symbolic regalia arranged in a vibrant, orderly composition. The use of parallel perspective creates a three-dimensional effect, emphasizing the Joseon court’s grandeur. Panel 8 lists the names, ranks, birth years, examination records, and clan origins of 25 officials from the Office of the Royal Secretariat (Sijeongwon), indicating the screen was commissioned by these officials to commemorate the event and likely distributed among them.  \n\nThis screen holds significant artistic and historical value, offering a vivid glimpse into 19th-century royal weddings. While slightly less refined artistically compared to contemporaneous works, its condition is superior to the designated version at Dong-A University Museum. Similar screens are housed in the National Museum of Korea and Dong-A University Museum, each with minor variations in composition and details. The Gyeonggi Museum of History’s version remains a crucial artifact for understanding late Joseon royal protocols and court culture.\"\n}",

      "name_en": "Portrait of Jeong Mong-ju (2011)",
      "content_en": "Jeong Mong-ju (鄭夢周, 1337–1392) was a scholar-official and Confucian academician of the late Goryeo Dynasty. Born into the Yeongil clan with the pen name Po-eun (圃隱), he passed the civil service examination with top honors in 1360 (9th year of King Gongmin’s reign) and held prominent positions such as Deputy Minister of Rites, Chancellor of the National University, Grand Academic Censor, and Minister of the Council of State. In 1389, he collaborated with Yi Seong-gye to enthrone King Gongyang but was assassinated by Yi Bang-won on Seonjuk Bridge after attempting to thwart plans by Jo Jun and Jeong Do-jeon to elevate Yi Seong-gye to power.\n\nThe portrait bears inscriptions on the left reading 'Gajeong (嘉靖) 000 Gobon (皐本)' and on the right 'Po-eun (圃隱) 000 Sang (像)'. Cross-referencing with the *Po-eunjip* (Po-eun Collection), the left inscription is inferred to be 'Gajeong Eulmyo Im Gobon (嘉靖乙卯臨皐本)', suggesting it was remade in 1555 (10th year of King Myeongjong’s reign). Historical records indicate the original portrait was painted in 1390 (2nd year of King Gongyang’s reign) to commemorate Jeong Mong-ju’s designation as a meritorious subject (Jomyeong Gongsin) for his role in enthroning the king. Though the original no longer exists, copies derived from it are housed at Imgo Seowon, Po-eun Shrine in Yongin, Usang Shrine in Jangheung, the National Museum of Korea (Lee Han-cheol’s copy), and Seoul National University Museum (sketch). All share identical stylistic features as they originate from the same prototype.\n\nThe current portrait, housed at the Gyeonggi Museum of History, is presumed to be the 1555 copy. Donated by the Yeongil Jeong clan in 2006, it comprises three joined panels and underwent restoration in 2007, revealing extensive back-coating (baechae) on the hat, face, robe, and footrest. The painting depicts Jeong Mong-ju in a full-length seated pose facing slightly left (90-degree angle), wearing a black sammo (official hat) with a low, rounded crown and narrow downward-curving horns, and a danryeong robe (originally blue but now faded to gray). The robe’s tight collar and narrow sleeves reflect late Goryeo–early Joseon styles, while a golden belt (sogeumdae) is tied at the waist.\n\nThe face, rendered in pale flesh tones, shows flaking, especially around the left eye. Brown ink outlines the facial features and wrinkles. The right eye has subtle grayish-brown pupils and eyelids without eyelashes. The mouth is shaded with dark red, outlined in light ink. Robe contours and folds are depicted with fine, sharp ink lines, while chair drapery uses intersecting vertical and horizontal strokes. A purple cushion strap on the chair and black leather shoes (heukpihwa) on a bare footrest are notable details. These elements align with late Goryeo–early Joseon meritorious subject portraits, such as those of Lee Cheon-u and Lee Saek.\n\nThis portrait is significant not only as an image of Korea’s quintessential loyal scholar but also as a mid-Joseon copy faithfully preserving the original’s stylistic traits. Predating the previously oldest known Jeong Mong-ju portrait (designated Treasure in 1991) by approximately 70 years, it holds substantial cultural value.",

Key features include the notably low height of the o-samo hat, with wide, rounded horns extending sideways and thickly outlined borders without color gradation. The posture emphasizes a 7-faceted angle, with pronounced differences in the slope and form of the shoulders: the left shoulder appears round and thick, while the right shoulder line shows a steep incline. The upper body is rendered in a 7-faceted perspective, whereas the lower body adopts an 8–9-faceted angle, creating a slight twist compared to earlier merit subject portraits (Seonmu, Hosung, Cheongnan) that only depicted openings on the left side of the robe.

Subtle red accents (honggi or jegi) are applied to the protruding bone areas (o-ak) of the facial structure, suggesting the underlying bone structure to convey depth. The danryeong robe is outlined with thick black lines, and wrinkles are sketched simply without shading.

      "content_en": "This cultural heritage consists of two portraits of Jo Yeong-bok (1672–1728), a civil official from the reign of King Sukjong of Joseon. One depicts him wearing a white doropga (robe), while the other shows him in formal official attire (gongbok). Jo passed the civil service examination in 1705 (31st year of Sukjong's reign) and held various government positions. The doropga portrait, painted by his younger brother Jo Yeong-seok (1686–1761) in 1724 (4th year of King Gyeongjong's reign), measures 125 cm in height and 76 cm in width. It portrays Jo seated in a full-length pose facing right, a rarity in Joseon portraits for showing both hands. The piece vividly captures the dignified demeanor of a yangban scholar, making it a highly valuable artwork. The second portrait, painted by renowned artist Jin Jae-hai in 1725 (1st year of King Yeongjo's reign), measures 154 cm in height and 79 cm in width. It depicts Jo seated on a chair facing right, wearing formal attire. Notable for its meticulous and detailed brushwork, this piece reflects the style of meritorious subject portraits from the late 17th to early 18th century. The two portraits, created consecutively for the same figure, provide an excellent comparative resource for studying differences in artistic approach and purpose.",

While Joseon officially adhered to the Ming Dynasty's legal codes and calendars, regional discrepancies in timekeeping and seasonal markers, along with delays in receiving Chinese almanacs, necessitated the creation of localized calendars. This Gyeongjin Year (1580) edition comprises 15 chapters: the first details the 24 solar terms across 13 months (including a leap fourth month) and a directional map; chapters 2–14 outline monthly calendars with daily auspicious and inauspicious activities; and the final chapter lists taboos by sexagenary cycle and names contributors. Though dated to 1580, it was likely printed in 1579, as calendars were traditionally produced before the lunar new year. As the sole surviving pre-Imjin War (1592–1598) calendar printed by the Joseon Astronomical Observatory (Gwanghwamun), it holds significant value for studies on Joseon typography and bibliography, showcasing early metal movable type (Inryeokja) used for calendar production.",

Korean celestial maps, excluding simple star paintings in ancient tombs, are categorized into these two types. The first three panels depict the 'Cheonsang Yeolcha Bunyajido,' a stone-engraved traditional map from the early Joseon period. The following four panels illustrate the 'Sinbeop Cheonmundo,' showing the Northern and Southern Celestial Hemispheres around the ecliptic.

The 'Sinbeop Cheonmundo' section uses modern planetary names (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Saturn), suggesting this artifact was created slightly earlier than the designated Treasure, around 1720–1730.

The described copy, housed at the Academy of Korean Studies, comprises Volumes 2 and 10 of a 1462 woodblock edition produced by the Ganggyeongdogam (Bureau of Buddhist Tripiṭaka Publishing) during King Sejo's reign. Notable features include corrections made by pasting revised characters over errors, primarily in the Hangul syllable '아' (from the name Ānanda). The Chinese text is rendered in a refined clerical script (haseo) influenced by King Sejo's handwriting and Song dynasty calligraphic styles, while the Hangul employs a square Gothic-type font with side dots (bangjeom), offering critical insights into 15th-century Korean phonology. As a completed edition of the Eulhae-type translated scriptures, this version set a standard for later Korean Buddhist publications and is highly valued for its integration of Hangul and Dongguk Jeongun-style Chinese character pronunciations.",

Panel 2 illustrates Cheongnyeongpo (淸泠浦), the king's exile site, as a boldly composed real-landscape painting. Panel 3 renders Gwanpungheon (觀風軒), a hall in Yeongwol's guesthouse, using meticulous architectural painting (계화) techniques. Panel 4 centers on Jaguryu Pavilion (子規樓), located southeast of Gwanpungheon. Panel 5 features Changjeolsa Shrine (彰節社), dedicated to the Six Martyred Ministers who remained loyal to the king. Panel 6 depicts Nakhwaram (落花巖), where the king's attendants met their deaths, in a landscape style. Panel 7 presents Yeongwol County Office (治所) as a pictorial map with a bird's-eye-view composition. Panel 8 is a regional map of Yeongwol. Each panel includes brief inscriptions about the depicted sites in the upper-right corner. The album is executed with refined brushwork, vibrant colors, and precise detailing, reflecting influences of true-view landscape painting (진경산수화) in its mountain and tree renderings. Its high artistic quality suggests it was created for royal viewing, with its production dated to the early 19th century based on comparisons to works like Donggwoldo (東闕圖).",

It exemplifies his renowned mastery of both Wang Xizhi’s and Zhao Mengfu’s styles. The scroll comprises three sections: the front features Fan Jun’s 『Fan’s Admonitions on the Heart (范氏心箴)』 written in neat regular script (楷書), the middle presents Du Fu’s long poem 『Lament at Jiangdu (哀江頭)』 in Jo’s distinctive running script (行書), and the back includes three seven-character regulated verses by Du Fu in smaller running-cursive script (行草). The colophon at the end, dated to the tenth month of 1647 (shortly before Jo’s death at age 58), states: 'Written in late autumn of Dinghai year at a thatched house west of the city for Sim Su-jae (丁亥孟冬雪汀翁爲沈秀才書于城西草屋).' This scroll is exceptionally rare, as most of Jo’s works are limited to a few letters.

It features a '丁'-shaped layout, combining a main hall (정전) of three bays (칸) in width and two bays in depth with a two-bay auxiliary hall (배위청). Constructed in 1408 (8th year of King Taejong's reign), the structure underwent multiple repairs throughout the Joseon period, notably a major renovation in 1764 (40th year of King Yeongjo's reign) due to significant deterioration. The building exemplifies the typical form of Joseon-era jeongjagak, with its bracket system (익공) reflecting 18th-century architectural techniques, thus preserving the characteristics of the 1764 restoration.\n\nAccording to the 『Gukjo Oreui Seorye (국조오례서례)』 under the 'Danmyodo-seol (단묘도설)' section on mountain tombs: 'The ceremonial hall (침전) is located south of the tomb chamber, facing north. It comprises three bays with staircases on the east and west sides, and the spirit seat (신좌) faces south.' Here, the 'three bays' refer exclusively to the main hall where rituals are conducted; when combined with the auxiliary hall, the total spans five bays.\n\nComparing this record to Geonwonneung's Jeongjagak, it retains its original structural framework from the early Joseon period. Beyond its symbolic significance as the tomb of King Taejo, the first ruler of Joseon, this building holds immense historical, artistic, and academic value as the standard model for jeongjagak in Joseon royal tomb architecture.",

In 1717, he requested a provincial position as magistrate of Gangseo to care for his aging parents. During the political turmoil of the Sinim Sahwa (1721–1722), he was exiled to Taein and later Cheongha for refusing to participate in a merit subjects’ oath.

The text is housed in three locations: Jajaeam Temple in Dongducheon, Seoul National University's Kyujanggak Institute, and Cheongju Early Printing Museum.\n\nThe Heart Sutra, condensed into 260 characters, encapsulates the essence of the Perfection of Wisdom sutras, emphasizing the concept of 'emptiness' (Skt. śūnyatā)—the idea that all phenomena lack inherent existence and are interdependent. This sutra is recited in all Korean Buddhist rituals.\n\nThe 1495 reprint differs from the original 1464 edition by omitting the preface by Hwang Su-sin and the colophon by Han Gye-hee, instead including a 1495 colophon by Hakjo printed in Eulhaejatype. The text begins with the title 『The Illustrated Commentary on the Heart Sutra with Explanations and Preface』 followed by Zhongxi's authorship notation. The commentary on the Heart Sutra starts on page 15.\n\nPhysically, the reprint shows minor wear but remains well-preserved.

The paper, a coarse 'printing paper' (ingyeongji) used from the late King Seongjong to King Jungjong periods, differs from the original's 'straw-pulp paper' (gojungji).

Located in Donggureung, Guri, it is the third tomb complex constructed within the site. The tomb follows the 'dong-won-i-gang-reung' (同原異岡陵) format, where a single ceremonial pavilion (jeongjagak) serves multiple burial mounds situated on separate hills within the same site.\n\nOriginally, Yureung (裕陵), the tomb of Queen Inin, was established in 1600 (33rd year of King Seonjo). After King Seonjo's death in 1608, his tomb, Mokreung, was initially built west of Geonwolleung (current site of King Heonjong's Gyeongreung). However, due to flooding and unfavorable terrain, it was relocated to its present location in 1630 (8th year of King Injo), and the tomb names Yureung and Mokreung were merged under the single designation 'Mokreung.' In 1632 (10th year of King Injo), Queen Inmok's tomb was added to the east of King Seonjo's mound, completing the current configuration.\n\nThe jeongjagak is a '丁'-shaped structure used for ancestral rites. The existing pavilion was relocated in 1630 during the tomb's move and integrated with the original pavilion of Yureung. It underwent multiple repairs, notably in 1745, 1749, and 1769, due to insect damage to its pillars.\n\nArchitecturally, the jeongjagak comprises five bays: three in the main hall (jeongjeon) and two in the preparatory hall (baewicheong). Unlike typical jeongjagaks, which use a single pillar and a bracket system (madumgo), Mokreung's pavilion uniquely employs two high pillars (goju) to directly support the main beam (jongbo). The bracket system (gongpo) follows a multi-bracket (dapo) style, resembling the 17th-century reconstruction of Munmyo Daeseongjeon, making it a significant example for studying early Joseon bracket techniques.\n\nAs the only surviving multi-bracket jeongjagak among Joseon royal tombs, Mokreung's pavilion retains its 1630 structure and reflects pre-decorative architectural elements. Its historical, academic, and artistic value lies in preserving the transitional phase of bracket design before the emergence of ornate styles.",

The lower sections of these slits are carved into a concave '∪' shape from the fortress wall's stone blocks, connecting to the upper brick sections. The architectural system of the Suwon Seobuk Gongsimdon is unique to Hwaseong among extant fortress structures, distinguished by its flexible use of materials, functional design, innovative stone-masonry techniques in the bastion, brick construction methods in the upper levels, and integrated defensive features such as gun ports, arrow slits, and hanging windows. It exemplifies original architectural form and aesthetic value.",

      "content_en": "Heo Jeon (1797–1886) was a prominent scholar-official of the late Joseon Dynasty, known by his courtesy name I-ro (而老) and pen name Seongjae (性齋). Rising to prominence after passing the civil service examinations in 1835, he held various governmental posts, including county magistrate, ministerial roles, and positions in the royal court. Renowned for his ethical governance, he abolished punitive instruments during his tenure as magistrate of Hampyeong, emphasizing moral education over harsh laws. A scholar of the Giho School, he compiled the *Sai-ui* (士儀), a practical guide to ritual propriety that diverged from rigid Neo-Confucian traditions. His intellectual legacy includes works like *Jongyo-rok* (宗堯錄) and *Cheolmyeong-pyeon* (哲命編), reflecting his synthesis of Confucian philosophy and practical governance.\n\nThe portrait, commissioned by royal decree, depicts Heo Jeon seated with an air of solemnity, clad in a black hat and dark robe. Before him lies a desk adorned with the *Juja Daejeon* (朱子大全, Collected Works of Zhu Xi), symbolizing his scholarly dedication. Painted in the late 19th-century tradition, the work incorporates props like books and ritual objects, a trend emerging in 18th-century portraits to signify status and intellectual pursuits. The artist meticulously rendered Heo’s facial features—using delicate lines for the eyelids, grayish irises to convey aged wisdom, and layered textures for skin and drapery—capturing both physical likeness and inner character. This alignment with the *jeonsinsa-jo* (傳神寫照) principle, which prioritizes conveying the subject’s spirit over mere appearance, underscores the portrait’s artistic and cultural significance. Originally preserved by his family, it was later housed in Yeotaekdang (麗澤堂) in Sancheong and donated to the Gyeonggi Museum of History in 2008. The portrait stands as a testament to Heo Jeon’s scholarly integrity and the evolving aesthetics of Joseon portraiture.",

Discovered on May 18, 2001, during grave maintenance, the set includes six white porcelain stele tablets housed in a stone coffin. These tablets belonged to Lady Incheon Lee (1383–1456), the wife of Yun Beon (1384–1448) and mother of Queen Jeonghui (1418–1483), the consort of King Sejo. The stone coffin, bound with copper strings, contained the stele tablets in a slightly moist condition. The rectangular stone coffin was meticulously carved to precisely fit the porcelain tablets inside.\n\nAmong the six tablets, the front and back ones are plain white porcelain, likely serving as protective covers. The four middle tablets feature blue-underglaze (cheonghwa) inscriptions detailing Lady Lee's life, death in 1456 (the 7th year of the Jingtai era, marked as 'Jingtai 7th year, bingja year'), burial on October 8, 1456, her virtues, genealogy, and descendants. The reverse sides of these four tablets are numbered '1st to 4th' in blue underglaze.\n\nThis artifact is historically significant as the earliest known example of blue-underglaze porcelain with a dated inscription (1456), providing critical insights into the production timeline of cheonghwa white porcelain. Technically, the tablets are larger than later examples and were fired upright, contrasting with the horizontal firing method used in subsequent periods. Additionally, their interment in a stone coffin, rather than porcelain boxes common in later practices, offers valuable information about early burial customs and porcelain production techniques.",

Created between 1796 and 1799, the wooden plates feature illustrative woodcuts (변상도), text divisions (과판), Chinese characters, and Korean script, with relief carvings on both sides. The bronze plates bear single-sided relief carvings of seven illustrative woodcuts, while the stone plates display text divisions and Chinese characters in intaglio on one side. Notably, the wooden plates replicate the same carving techniques as the bronze ones. Commissioned by King Jeongjo, these blocks were initially stored at the Royal Foundry (주자소) before being relocated to Yongju Temple in Hwaseong, as documented in the 『Regulations for the Foundry Office (주자소응행절목)』. The blocks exemplify exquisite craftsmanship and grandeur. The illustrative woodcuts preserve the artistic style of the renowned painter Kim Hong-do (1745–?), while the text reflects the calligraphic elegance of Hwang Un-jo (1730–1800), a celebrated scribe of the era. Today, Yongju Temple's edition of the sutra is acclaimed as one of the world's most beautiful religious texts, a testament to King Jeongjo's profound filial piety and the meticulous artistry of 18th-century masters. These blocks hold significant cultural value due to their pristine condition, their role as linguistic resources for 18th-century Korean, and the innovative spatial depth in their illustrative woodcuts, distinguishing them from earlier printing traditions.",

According to the inscribed text on the bell's body, it was cast in 1223 as a bell for Daehyeowon Temple in Jukju (near modern-day Anseong, Gyeonggi Province).\n\nThe bell's form features a sound tube (音筒) beneath the canon (종뉴), with a bulging body adorned with a raised floral band (입상화문대). While the overall shape, placement of upper and lower bands, and omega-shaped bell loop (Ω식 종유) follow the Silla dynasty style, the arrangement of the raised floral band is characteristic of late Goryeo bells. It closely resembles other known Goryeo bells, such as the Pohang Oreosa Temple Bell and the Eulsa-myeong Bronze Bell (乙巳銘 銅鍾) in the National Museum of Korea, in terms of form, composition, and decorative motifs.\n\nThe canon depicts a four-clawed dragon (사조룡) holding a coin-shaped Cintamani jewel, its body curved in an S-shape and enveloping the sound tube with auspicious energy (서기). Though the left leg is missing, the dragon's fierce eyes, delicate fins, scales, and dynamic posture convey vitality.\n\nThe five-section sound tube features high-relief lotus patterns: the first and second sections have inverted and upright lotuses, the third a lotus flower, and the fourth and fifth upright lotuses. Small beads originally adorned the tube's end, but only one remains. The upper band's design resembles peonies, while the lower band mirrors the upper with peony scrolls, featuring lush blossoms and leaves on slender stems. Between the decorative panels (유곽) on the lower body, circular Sanskrit characters (원문범자) and seated Bodhisattva figures alternate. The Bodhisattva, wearing a three-faced crown, kneels on clouds in a meditative pose, closely resembling those on the Pohang Oreosa and Eulsa-myeong bells. The Sanskrit-decorated percussion mark (당좌) is unique, with a thunder-pattern outline and raised lotus petals.\n\nThe inscription records that in the 28th year of the Gye-mi cycle (1223), former Chief Household Manager (前 上戶長) commissioned the bell for Daehyeowon with 113 geun of metal. Retired officials, monks, and artisans, including 70-year-old former Chief Manager Choi, Hyundam, Jiseong, and monks from Namilwolsa Temple, participated in its creation.\n\nThis bell is dated to the early 13th century based on its late Goryeo features—such as the raised floral band and Bodhisattva imagery—and its stylistic similarities to the Pohang Oreosa and Eulsa-myeong bells. Its craftsmanship, while less refined than the Oreosa bell and more detailed than the Eulsa-myeong bell, supports the 1223 dating.",

The triad features an oval-shaped face with narrow, slightly upturned eyes, a flat transition from the forehead to the nasal bridge, a protruding philtrum, and a subtle smile with upturned corners of the mouth. The shoulders are relatively narrow compared to the head, and the body is depicted in a flat, planar style.\n\nThe main Buddha statue has large, rough curls (nava) along the hairline, with smaller curls above. The hands, made of wood, form the earth-touching mudra (right hand) and the teaching gesture (left hand, thumb and middle finger touching). The drapery of the inner and outer robes is rendered with flexible, intricate folds, showcasing the malleability of clay. The attendant bodhisattvas on either side have later-added crowns (bo-gwan) and share similar necklaces and hand gestures, but differ in their attire: the left Bodhisattva of Wisdom (Bohyeonbosal) wears a shawl-like celestial robe draped over the shoulders and wrists, while the right Bodhisattva of Wisdom (Munsubosal) is clad in a monk’s robe (kasaya) resembling the Buddha’s outer garment.\n\nAn inscription found within the main statue’s robe reveals that the triad was crafted in 1603 (31st year of the Manchu Wanli era) under the supervision of the chief sculptor-monk Gwangwon (廣圓). The inscription, written in red ink on blue silk, lists six artisans, including a non-monk painter named Lee Geum-jeong (李今貞), highlighting an unusual collaboration between monastic and lay artists.

This style is represented by other notable works, including the 1330 Gilt-bronze Avalokiteshvara Statue from Buseoksa Temple, Seosan (enshrined at Kannon-ji Temple, Tsushima), the 1333 Gilt-bronze Standing Avalokiteshvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattvas (formerly in the collection of the Imperial Household Museum, now at the National Museum of Korea), the Gilt-bronze Bodhisattva Statue at the National Jeonju Museum, the Gilt-bronze Bodhisattva Statue of Unjangam Hermitage in Cheongyang, and the Gilt-bronze Ksitigarbha Statue of Dosolam Hermitage at Seonunsa Temple, which also falls within this stylistic category.\n\nCharacteristics of this form include a plump, square face with realistic facial features, neatly arranged bangs, hair cascading over the shoulders, elaborate necklaces on the chest, and pendants adorning the knees. The bodhisattva wears a robe with sleeves and forms the vitarka mudra (teaching gesture) with the thumb and index finger touching, while a knot from the inner garment is visible. A distinctive feature is the triangular inner garment decoration protruding from the left chest, likely created by layering thick fabric and draped over the shoulder. This decorative element first appeared in late Tang to Five Dynasties period sculptures, exemplified by the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s wooden bodhisattva statue. The 1306 Amida Nyorai painting at the Nezu Museum depicts intricate patterns on the inner garment, suggesting that Goryeo-period Buddhist statues, such as the Yongmunsa Avalokiteshvara, sought to sculpturally emulate such opulence through carved round floral motifs.\n\nApart from a later-added crown, the Yongmunsa statue is well-preserved and artistically outstanding, serving as an exemplary representation of 14th-century Goryeo gilt-bronze bodhisattva sculptures.",

The Buddha and bodhisattvas share elongated faces and upper bodies, with the Buddha's usnisa (topknot) notably extended, creating a distinctive aesthetic. The Buddha's large, tightly coiled usnisa curls and simplified robe drapery reflect characteristics prevalent from the early Joseon period.\n\nThe shading technique under the Buddha's eyes, resembling dark circles, and the thick, drooping lower lip may be associated with the sculptors Inil (仁日) and Sucheon (守天). The bodhisattvas, dated to 1610 according to their dedicatory inscription, share a stylistic affinity with the 1620 Yaksu Seonwon Bodhisattva Standing Statue (currently housed at Dongguk University Museum).\n\nThe left attendant bodhisattva wears a celestial robe (cheonyuisik), while the right one dons a monastic robe (daeuisik).

Measuring 73.5 cm in height, the bell features a compact yet ornate design, with its body divided into sections adorned with intricate patterns such as lotus petals, vine scrolls, and wave motifs. The dragon-shaped handle (yongnyu) is crafted with two dragons intertwined back-to-back, providing stability while their dynamic posture lifting the canopy evokes a sense of movement. The bell's form gracefully widens from the rounded canopy to its mouth, enhancing its aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe bell follows the Chinese-style tradition derived from the late Goryeo period Yeonboksa bells. Notably, it is divided by three raised lines at the center, with patterns including small diamond-shaped lotus compartments containing bead-like lotus buds, coiled lotus motifs on the canopy resembling floral designs, bead patterns above, dynamic lotus vine motifs on the lower body, and wave patterns symbolizing rippling water at the base. These decorative elements align with the royal-sponsored bell traditions of the early Joseon period, as seen in the 1469 Bongseonsa Bell, Heungcheonsa Bell, and the 1491 Haeinsa Bell. Given Bongseonsa's status as a royal temple, the bell reflects court-style craftsmanship.\n\nThe inscription on the bell's surface, carved in regular script by the monk Cheonbo in 1619 (11th year of King Gwanghae's reign), records the bell's commission, materials used, weight, dedicatory prayers, and contributors. Cheonbo, recognized as the sole monk metalworker active before and after the Imjin War (1592–1598), is crucial for understanding the lineage of bell-making techniques and stylistic evolution during this period.\n\nCast in 1619, this bell inherits the early Joseon court-style tradition, exhibits excellent preservation, and harmoniously integrates vibrant decorative motifs, imbuing it with vitality. It remains a vital resource for studying late Joseon bronze bell craftsmanship.",

The lower section features six bodhisattvas, Indra and Brahma, the Ten Great Disciples, and central figures such as celestial musicians, the Dragon King, and Dragon Princess. While the composition integrates the Trikaya with their retinues, the prominent placement of the three buddhas at the top creates a visual emphasis on the triad, a characteristic shared with 18th-century Seoul-Gyeonggi region triad gwaebuldo paintings, including the Hakrimsa Gwaebuldo (1774 restoration) and Wongongam Gwaebuldo (1806).\n\nNotably, this painting portrays Vairochana and Sakyamuni as traditional buddhas, while Nosana wears an ornate crown, a stylistic choice mirrored in the Hakrimsa Gwaebuldo. The chief painter Gakchong (覺總) and Chilhye (七惠), who participated in the 18th-century Hakrimsa Gwaebuldo project, collaborated here.

The tomb follows a twin-mound (雙陵) format, with the burial mounds of the king and queen placed side by side on the same hillside.\n\nThe Jeongjagak (정자각), a '丁'-shaped ceremonial hall where ancestral rites are performed, was built in 1674 (the first year of King Sukjong's reign) following King Hyeonjong's death. This structure is the only surviving example among the 40 Joseon royal tombs to retain a hipped-and-gabled roof (팔작지붕). It comprises 8 rooms: 5 in the main hall (정전) and 3 in the dais area (배위청).\n\nThe expansion from the traditional 5-room Jeongjagak to an 8-room structure resulted from the integration of the Yeongakjeon (靈幄殿), a temporary vault for housing royal coffins. Originally, the Yeongakjeon was larger to accommodate the coffin chamber (찬궁) and ritual equipment. However, due to financial strain and public hardship from consecutive royal funerals (including the relocation of Hyojong's tomb and the funerals of Queen Inhyeon and King Hyeonjong between 1673–1674), King Sukjong downsized the construction, merging the Yeongakjeon's functions into the Jeongjagak.\n\nHistorical records such as the 『Sanneungdogam Uigwe』 (산릉도감의궤) indicate that the Jeongjagaks of Sejong's Yeongneung (英陵), Myeongjong's Gangneung (康陵), Injo's Jangneung (長陵), and Hyojong's Yeongneung (寧陵) originally featured hipped-and-gabled roofs but were later replaced with gable roofs (맞배지붕).

The text details Kim Myeong-ri's family background, parents, and career, composed as a biographical record (haengjang) by Yu Ui-son (1398–1450). The epitaph was written in the late 10th month of the winter season in 1439 (the 4th year of the Zhengtong era, a year after Kim's death in December 1438), suggesting the stele was crafted around this period. Though documenting personal history, the stele holds significant historical value as it supplements primary sources from early Joseon. Its neatly executed clerical script (haseo-che) also contributes to the study of early Joseon calligraphy. Additionally, the stele's clear provenance, precise dating to 1439, and its uncommon bell shape render it highly valuable from both ceramic and paleographic perspectives.",

The *Portrait of Seo Gyeong-u and Its Case* is a well-preserved 17th-century artwork that exemplifies the sophistication and characteristics of Joseon-era portraiture. Depicting Seo Gyeong-u in a three-quarter left-facing seated pose on a chair, the portrait features him wearing an official black *danryeong* (robe) with a twin crane (*ppang-hak heungbae*) badge. To emphasize stability, the shoulders and angular slopes are slightly exaggerated. The hat (*osa-mo*) reflects early 17th-century styles, with a flat crown, wide and short rounded edges, and cloud patterns rendered in light ink within thick black outlines. His complexion is pale with light brown facial features, while subtle shading adds depth to wrinkles and a profile-view nose. The serious expression, with faint wrinkles between the eyebrows, suggests a contemplative demeanor, likely painted during his 40s in the Gwanghaegun era. The *danryeong* robe, thickly painted with black cloud patterns, minimizes drapery lines, revealing a green inner robe (*naegong*) and blue *jeollik* (lining) with intricate designs. The crane badge stands out for its meticulous depiction of feathers, peonies, and clouds, offering rare insight into contemporary court decorative art. The chair’s outward-extending arms are a hallmark of early 17th-century portraiture. The case, from the late Joseon period, shares historical context with the portrait, enhancing its value as a nationally designated cultural heritage.",

Affiliated with the Noron faction, he made significant contributions to military reforms and famine relief. The portrait, a full-length seated figure in ceremonial attire, exemplifies high artistic achievement in Joseon portraiture. Depicting Seo wearing a black horsehair hat (osa-mo) and a light pink ceremonial robe (si-bok) with a sash of geometric patterns (sang-eun-dae), the painting shows him seated on a chair covered with leopard skin, with a plain mat on the footrest.

The hat’s left horn is slightly elongated, directing the gaze to the right. The robe’s deep collar and rigid, symmetrical sleeves with minimal texture—rendered in thin pink lines—reflect early 18th-century stylistic conventions. The footrest combines frontal and lateral perspectives, with the mat’s upper part widening backward in reverse perspective.

      "content_en": "The Octagonal Five-story Stone Pagoda of Sujongsa Temple is a Joseon-era stone pagoda located at Sujongsa Temple on the mid-slope of Ungilsan Mountain in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province. Sujongsa, a subordinate temple of Bongseonsa (the 25th district head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism), is said to have been founded in 1459 (the 5th year of King Sejo’s reign). The pagoda originally stood on a ridge east of the temple, offering a panoramic view of Yangsu-ri, where the Namhangang and Bukhangang Rivers converge. It was later relocated beside the Daeungjeon Hall, alongside a stone stupa and smaller pagodas.\n\nThis pagoda inherits the tradition of octagonal stone pagodas from the Goryeo period, such as the Octagonal Nine-story Stone Pagoda at Woljeongsa Temple and the Octagonal Thirteen-story Stone Pagoda at Bohyunsa Temple in North Korea. However, it reflects the early Joseon style through its smaller scale and decorative elements. During restoration work in 1957, 19 Buddhist statues were discovered in the first-story body stone, roof stone, and the middle base of the foundation. An additional 12 statues were found in the second and third roof stones during repairs before 1970. Inscriptions on these statues reveal that two of them—a Shakyamuni Buddha and a Guanyin Bodhisattva—were commissioned by Myeongbin Kim (a concubine of King Taejong who died in 1479) and enshrined in 1493 (the 6th year of the Hongchi era) by concubines of King Seongjong. Others, including a gilt-bronze Vairocana Buddha statue (with an inscribed base), were dedicated by Queen Inmok (Jeonguidae Wangtaebi) and crafted by the sculptor Seongin in 1628 (the first year of the Chongdeok reign). These findings confirm that the pagoda was constructed by at least 1493 and renovated in 1628, with royal patronage.\n\nThe pagoda’s structure features an octagonal base resembling a Buddhist lotus pedestal. Each side of the octagonal platform is divided into two rectangular panels engraved with lotus motifs (ansang), a design consistent across the base, body, and roof supports. The upper and lower lotus petals on the base have 16 lobes with elaborate floral decorations popular since the mid-Goryeo period. The octagonal middle base has rounded corner pillars (ujang) carved in relief. Each of the five stories has rounded corner pillars, and the roof stones feature three-tiered eaves, evoking wooden architecture. The finial includes a lotus blossom (bokbal) and jewel (bojua) adorned with triangular patterns resembling a gabled roof.\n\nAs the only surviving octagonal five-story stone pagoda from the Joseon period, this pagoda holds significant historical and academic value. Its confirmed construction date, intact structure, and unique synthesis of Buddhist pedestal, wooden architectural, and gabled roof styles underscore its importance. The discovery of relics and inscriptions further attests to its royal origins and artistic evolution from Goryeo to Joseon traditions.",

The Yuan Dynasty compiled legal codes twice, in 1323 and 1346, but no copies had been discovered in China until 2003, when this set was found in Korea. Though incomplete, these volumes (1–12, 23–34) are the only extant Yuan legal code globally. They were preserved by the Gyeongju Son clan of Yangdong Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and likely acquired through early Joseon officials like Son Sa-seong (1396–1435) and Son So (1433–1484), who worked at the Seungmunwon (Royal Document Office) and may have studied Yuan law. The code influenced Goryeo and Joseon legal systems, as evidenced by records in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty and Seungjeongwon Ilgi. King Sejong reprinted 50 copies in 1423, and King Seongjong distributed it to scholars in 1493. It served as a reference until the promulgation of the Gyeongguk Daejeon (1485). As the sole surviving Yuan legal text, it holds immense academic value for studying East Asian legal history and bibliography, warranting its designation as a national treasure.",

Renowned for its grand scale, well-preserved condition, and intricate iconography, the stupa serves as a critical artifact for understanding the stylistic elements, Buddhist symbolism, and decorative motifs of royal-sponsored Buddhist art in Joseon Korea. Located within the historic site of Hoeamsaji, archaeological investigations, topographical analysis, and historical records confirm its identity as a Buddhist stupa housing sacred relics. The carvings on the stupa exhibit stylistic affinities with contemporaneous royal stone monuments, while also suggesting artistic exchanges with the nearby Three Saints' Stupas within the Hoeamsa complex.\n\nThe stupa comprises an octagonal multi-tiered base, a spherical tower body, and a finial. Its foundation features a two-layered octagonal base, distinguished by exceptionally tall and thickly carved stone slabs, making it the tallest extant base among known sarira stupas. Each face of the base is adorned with elaborate carvings, including dragons, giraffes, floral patterns (chohwa-mun), scroll motifs (dangcho-mun), and the Eight Divine Guardians (palsubjung), arranged sequentially from the lower to upper tiers. The tower body, surmounted by a spherical stone and a tiered finial, rests on a low octagonal platform atop the base. This layered structure—comprising four distinct sections from the foundation to the finial—reflects sophisticated craftsmanship.\n\nThe overall design, construction techniques, and decorative details align closely with royal stone monuments of the early Joseon era, including royal tombs. The stupa's scale, precision in stone carving, and assembly methods suggest involvement of the period's foremost artisans. As a pinnacle of early Joseon stone artistry, this cultural heritage holds immense historical, academic, and aesthetic value.",

After the abolition of Suoecheong's administrative office in 1795, it functioned as the main headquarters of Suoecheong and the office of the Gwangju Yusu (local governor). Records of three major renovations since its construction are confirmed through inscriptions on the upper beams and plaques, with the current plaque dating to 1762 (38th year of King Yeongjo's reign).\n\nArchitecturally, the building measures 5 kan (bays) in width and 4 kan in depth, with recessed spaces (toegan) on the front and rear, and side extensions (tobo) on both flanks. Notably, as a military facility, the central columns were shifted backward to create a wall-enclosed space for the king or military commander. The structure employs cho-ikgong brackets and dancheong (decorative painting) characterized by modest yet dignified designs, including dragon motifs on the main ridge beams. The pillar bands (juryeon), larger than the columns themselves, completely encase the pillars, enhancing both protection and grandeur.\n\nBeyond its military function, Yeongmugwan historically served as a site where King Jeongjo directly engaged with the people during his visit to Namhansanseong, addressing their grievances and embodying his benevolent governance. Behind the building stood the office of the local magistrate (pangwan), with nearby administrative facilities such as Hyangcheong and Jakcheong.

King Jangjo was born in January 1735, and his placenta was enshrined in a chamber behind Myeongbongsa Temple in Myeongbong-ri, Sang-ri-myeon, Yecheon-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, in the fourth lunar month of the same year. Following King Jeongjo's posthumous honors for his father, the site was elevated to a royal placenta chamber (태실가봉) in 1785, with additional stone structures such as balustrade stones (난간석) installed.

It is speculated to have belonged to Chungwon Temple (忠圓寺), as a bowl inscribed with the temple's name was discovered during land preparation by Yu Jeong-rip, a county magistrate during King Injo's reign (Joseon Dynasty), who was dismissed and returned to his hometown after the 1623 coup. Severely damaged during the Korean War, the pagoda underwent full-scale restoration in 2000, revealing its original two-tiered base partially buried underground. Excavation confirmed that the seven-story tower body rests on a two-tiered base. The upper base is notably wide compared to the tower body, enhancing stability, and features a lotus-patterned stone slab supporting the first tier. The tower body gradually tapers upward, with its height balancing the disproportion between the broad base and smaller body, creating an overall sense of stability. The roof stones slope gently, with the eaves supported by six tiers on the 1st–3rd stories and five tiers from the 4th story upward. The slightly uplifted corners of the roof stones add a lightness to the structure. The pagoda is estimated to have been constructed around the mid-Goryeo period. Regrettably, the finial at the top is entirely missing, and the corners of the roof stones are heavily damaged.",

The temple's founding date was confirmed in 1948 with the discovery of a Silla-era bronze bell inscribed with the year 804. This stupa, completely destroyed during the Japanese occupation, was restored in November 1965 using collected fragments, though only its base (pedestal) remains today. The octagonal structure of the pedestal indicates it is a typical Silla stone stupa. It consists of a square foundation stone, lower, middle, and upper supports. The lower support has two tiers, with the bottom tier uniquely integrated with the foundation stone. The upper tier features boldly carved double layers of eight lotus petals and a thick two-tiered cornice. The middle support, nearly circular, displays majestic carvings of dragons and cloud patterns. The upper support replicates the lotus design of the lower tier. The stupa exhibits exceptional stability in its structural composition, with the emphasized lower support deviating from conventional octagonal stupa styles, suggesting it dates to the late Unified Silla period. Based on the stele of Honggak Seonsa found at the site and the identification of this stupa as his tomb, its construction is dated to 886 CE (the first year of King Jeonggang's reign).",

The inscribed body stone is currently fragmented and housed at the National Museum of Korea, while only the base and capstone remain at the original site. Jin-gong became a monk under Jang Sun Seonsa, studied in Tang China, and returned to Silla during the reign of King Gyeongmyeong (r. 917–924). He later became the king's spiritual mentor. After the founding of Goryeo, King Taejo requested him to stay as a teacher, but Jin-gong declined and retreated to Mount Sobaek for meditation. He passed away in 940, and King Taejo personally composed the epitaph. The stele was crafted by Choi Gwang-yun, who compiled calligraphy from Tang Taizong. The tortoise-shaped base resembles a dragon, with a wish pearl in its mouth and hexagonal patterns adorned with swastikas and lotuses. The capstone features the stele's name at the center, surrounded by dynamically carved dragons. Four dragons on the front glare intensely, while those on the sides and back survey their surroundings, showcasing the era's sophisticated artistic mastery.

Created when Yi was 42, it served as an introductory textbook for young learners beginning their education. Yi I, a pivotal figure in Joseon's mid-period, passed the civil service exam at 23 and held key positions, including Minister of Personnel. His Neo-Confucian philosophy profoundly influenced Korean history, and he advocated policies like the 'Ten Thousand Troops Proposal.' After his death, he was enshrined in over 20 shrines and posthumously honored with the title 'Munseong.'\n\nThis manuscript, written in running script on hanji (traditional Korean paper), is divided into ten chapters, starting with 'Establishing Resolve' (立志) and concluding with 'Conduct in Society' (處世). Notably, King Jeongjo added a preface in 1788, commissioned from scholar Lee Byeong-mo (1742–1806), which precedes the text. Widely circulated in woodblock and movable-type editions, this handwritten original is exceptionally rare. It was preserved by Yi's aunt's family, the Kwon clan, and remains the sole surviving autograph manuscript, elevating its historical and cultural value. Alongside Dongmongseonseop (童蒙先習), Geokmong Yogyeol became a foundational text for beginners until modern times.",

This places its creation in the late Unified Silla to early Goryeo period.

Based on ritual texts such as the 『Water and Land Ritual Without Obstacles and Equality』, 『Compendium of Rituals for the Water and Land Ceremony of Heaven and Earth』, and 『Collection of Five Kinds of Brahmin Sounds』, it depicts a gathering of three bodhisattvas: Heaven Storehouse Bodhisattva (天藏菩薩), Holder of the Earth Bodhisattva (持地菩薩), and Earth Storehouse Bodhisattva (地藏菩薩). The painting retains its original votive pouch, which contains a creation vow document, a relic container (後靈筒), and dharanis, with records of its production date and materials matching historical inscriptions. Although partial pigment flaking occurred due to horizontal and vertical folding, the work remains a masterpiece of early 18th-century Buddhist art, characterized by vibrant hues of green and red harmonized with yellow and blue, balanced figures, rounded faces, slightly upturned eyes, slender noses, and small tightly closed lips. Created for enshrinement during Water and Land Ceremonies (水陸齋) to guide the deceased and offer posthumous merits, it is deemed worthy of designation as a National Treasure for its historical, artistic, and religious significance.",

After being removed from Sinheungsa Temple, it wandered overseas for over 70 years before being recently repatriated from the United States. This artwork holds significance as it reflects the temple's historical ties to the royal court and its prosperity as a royal monastery.

It was later renovated in 776 (12th year of King Hyegong's reign) by Jinpyo and became a central site for Maitreya Buddhism under his disciples. The statue, carved in relief on a massive 6-meter-high rock, depicts the Buddha seated on a chair—a rare posture in Korean Buddhist art. Accompanied by a carving of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva on an adjacent rock, it symbolizes Beopjusa's role as a Maitreya-centered sanctuary.\n\nThe Buddha's head features tightly coiled spiral hair, a distinctive trait uncommon in rock-carved sculptures. The round, serene face is adorned with a long nose, rounded eyebrows, pronounced eyelids, and thick lips curving into a subtle smile. The elongated ears and three neck creases reflect the stylistic characteristics of early Goryeo-period rock-carved Buddhas. The statue's broad shoulders contrast with an unnaturally narrow waist, while the robe drapes elegantly over the left shoulder, flowing down to the legs. The right hand is raised to the chest with the palm outward and the middle finger bent to touch the thumb; the left hand extends horizontally with the palm upward.\n\nUniquely, the Buddha sits on a vibrant lotus pedestal with feet resting on large lotus leaves—a pose rarely seen in Korea. On the right rock face, carvings depict a figure leading a loaded horse and a kneeling cow, believed to illustrate the temple's founding legend: Monk Uisim transporting Buddhist scriptures and a cow seeking enlightenment. This statue stands as a representative masterpiece of Goryeo rock-carved Buddhism and a key symbol of Beopjusa's Maitreya heritage.",

The front panel illustrates dynamic scenes resembling the Pure Land, with repeated images of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. At the base, lotus flowers form a pedestal, flanked by railings and staircases. Wave patterns symbolize a pond, with lions facing each other on either side of the railings. A large central lotus blooms above the pond, supporting the principal Amitabha Buddha seated in meditation. Surrounding him are symmetrically arranged standing Buddhas, adhering to strict bilateral symmetry. The main Buddha’s robes drape both shoulders, with the right hand indistinct and the left held near the chest. Bodhisattvas flank the central figure, interspersed with the upper torsos of arhats who have attained nirvana. Adjacent to the bodhisattvas stand yaksha figures, one raising a hand to support a celestial palace, alongside guardian Inwang (Vajrapani) statues. Above the main Buddha, a semicircular arrangement of five small Buddhas is carved, followed by seven more, with tree branches, leaves, jewels, and ornaments symbolizing the splendor of paradise.

Born in 879 (the 5th year of King Heongang's reign of Unified Silla), Beopgyeong entered monastic life at 20. He traveled to Tang China in 906 to study under Master Dogyeon and returned to Korea in 924. King Gyeongae of Silla honored him as a national preceptor and appointed him abbot of Jeongtosa. After his death at age 63 in 941, King Taejo of Goryeo bestowed the posthumous title 'Beopgyeong' and named his stupa 'Jadeung.' The stele was erected in 943 (the 26th year of King Taejo's reign) to commemorate his virtues. The epitaph was composed by the literary scholar Choe Un-ui, with calligraphy by the renowned artist Gu Juk-dal.

The statues are in relatively good condition. \n\nVairocana Buddha has a square face, a sturdy and flat body without pronounced curves, and a monumental presence. The left hand is enclosed by the right in the wisdom knot mudra (知拳印), while the robes covering both shoulders flow symmetrically from the wrists, creating a decorative effect. \n\nAmitabha Buddha shares a similar style to Vairocana, with the left hand raised to the chest and the right resting on the abdomen, thumb and middle finger touching. \n\nSakyamuni Buddha exhibits the same bodily proportions and facial features as the other two. The right hand forms the earth-touching mudra (觸地印) with the fingertips pointing downward, a common gesture for Sakyamuni. Despite differences in mudra and symbolic meaning between Amitabha and Sakyamuni, their robe styles display strikingly uniform artistic characteristics. \n\nThe statues, noted for their robust build, youthful faces, and thickly rendered robe folds, exemplify a new sculptural style emerging after the Imjin War (1592–1598). They are regarded as a monumental work and a benchmark for studying late Joseon Buddhist sculptures. Although most relics inside the statues were stolen, surviving historical records (緣起文) indicate they were created in 1626 (4th year of King Injo’s reign) and regilded in 1747 (23rd year of King Yeongjo’s reign), 121 years later.",

Key documents include the 'Royal Certificate of Meritorious Subject for Suppressing Rebellion' (1604), a military appointment letter (1608), two posthumous title approvals (1811), a posthumous title decree (1812), a biographical record for the posthumous title (late 18th century), a subsidiary meritorious subject record (1605), and two alliance oath records of meritorious subjects (1694, 1728).\n\nSin Gyeong-haeng passed the civil service exam in 1577 and served as a military governor. In 1596, he suppressed a rebellion led by Yi Mong-hak in Chungcheong Province, earning the title of 'Cheongnan Gongsin' (Meritorious Subject for Suppressing Rebellion) and enfeoffment as Yeongseong-gun. Posthumously promoted to Minister of Rites, he was granted the posthumous title 'Chungik'.\n\nThe Royal Certificate (1604) details his meritorious recognition alongside other prominent subjects, offering critical insights into Joseon's reward systems and document formatting. The 1608 military appointment letter is rare for including a classified seal. The posthumous title documents (1811–1812) trace the formal process of bestowing 'Chungik', involving approvals from the Inspector-General and Censorate. The subsidiary meritorious subject record (1605) highlights hereditary privileges, while the alliance oaths (1694, 1728) document gatherings of descendants of 20/21 meritorious subjects, reflecting political dynamics during King Sukjong and King Youngjo's reigns.\n\nThis collection is invaluable for studying Joseon's bureaucratic practices, reward systems, and historiography, while also serving as a biographical resource on Sin Gyeong-haeng.",

      "content_en": "Gakseonsa Temple is located on the southern slope of Chilbosan Mountain. Approximately 1 km southeast of the temple stands the stele of Unified Great Master, and further southeast, a 30-minute climb toward the main peak of Bogaesan Mountain leads to the tower situated on the ridge of Jungbong Peak. The tower, originally collapsed, was discovered in 1965. Its scattered components were collected and restored by Goesan County between June and July 12, 1982, reaching its current state.\n\nThe tower is a typical octagonal stone pagoda with a base, body, and finial, measuring 2.3 m in total height. The base comprises a foundation stone (jidaseok), lower platform (hadaeseok), middle platform (jungdaeseok), and upper platform (sangdaeseok), all intact. The foundation and lower base are carved from a single stone, with the lower base featuring ornamental brackets (ansang) on its sides. The upper base and middle platform share a stone, adorned with inverted 16-petaled double lotus (bokyeon) on each of the eight sides. Traces of corner flowers (gwigot) are visible on the upper base, though they are damaged. A curved bracket support (gup-hyeong goeimdae) on the upper base holds the middle platform, which has pilasters (uju) at its corners. The upper platform, also a single stone, has a three-tiered angular molding on its base and upright 16-petaled double lotus (angyeon) on its sides, mirroring the lower base’s design. It supports the tower body via a low single-tier molding.\n\nThe tower body consists of a single stone for both the main tier (tapsinseok) and roof stone (okgaeseok). The main tier has pilasters at its corners and door-shaped carvings (munbihyeong) on the front and back, framed by double lines with patterns inside. The roof stone’s underside has a three-tiered angular molding and 32 upright double lotus petals (angyeon) along its eaves. The steeply sloped roof and thick eaves are depicted with thickly carved tile grooves. Corner flowers are placed at the roof’s edges, though four are missing and four are adhesively reattached. The top features a lotus band (bokyeon-dae) with 16 single petals. The finial (sangryunbu) is mostly lost, leaving only the finial base (noban), which shares a stone with the roof. Its sides have 16 upright single lotus petals, and a hole (chaljugong) for the finial rod remains at the top.\n\nThis tower exemplifies exceptional craftsmanship and retains all original components despite its restoration. It faithfully follows the octagonal stone pagoda style established in the Unified Silla period while reflecting early Goryeo techniques. The stele, dated between 858 and 960 CE, confirms the tower was likely built contemporaneously. Unlike most stone pagodas placed near temples, this tower is situated on a mountain ridge, offering panoramic views of the temple and surroundings—a rare feature shared with only a few other pagodas, such as those at Ssanggyesa, Bohyeonsa, and Bongamsa. This unique placement is thought to reflect the 9th-century mountain and river protection ideology (sancheon bibosaang), which influenced the construction of stone pagodas on mountain summits.",

Standing 335 cm tall, it features a single-tier base atop a foundation stone, with three tiers of body stones. Constructed on an earthen platform, the pagoda remains largely intact from its foundation to the topmost tier.\n\nThe foundation (jidaseok) comprises six stone slabs. The upper surface has protruding eave lines at each corner, with a 3 cm-deep groove carved in the center to secure the base stone. The base (gidanbu) is formed by four stone blocks, each adorned with carved corner pillars (yang-uju) and central pillars (taengju). The capstone (gapseok) is a single slab with a central groove for the first-tier body stone, and its corners also feature protruding eave lines.\n\nThe first-tier body stone consists of four slabs, with corner pillars carved on each face; the south and north-facing slabs are modern replacements. The second and third tiers are each carved from a single stone, with the second tier exhibiting entasis (a slight convex curvature) on its corner pillars. The third-tier body stone appears to be a later replacement.\n\nAll three roof stones (okgaeseok) are monolithic. The eaves are short and steeply sloped, with five-tier supports on the first tier and four-tier supports on the upper tiers. The eaves are relatively thick, with rounded edges contrasting typical straight-edged designs, creating sharp upward curves at the corners. A low rectangular step on each roof stone supports the tier above. At the summit, a finial base (noban) with a central hole and a lotus-shaped ornament (bokbal) remain.\n\nStylistically, the pagoda is dated to the early Goryeo period. While its first-tier construction follows the tradition of Silla-era pagodas, the grooved base stones reflect the Baekje-style techniques prevalent in Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces. Despite partial replacements of components, this pagoda exemplifies the Goryeo dynasty's synthesis of Baekje and Silla architectural traditions, making it a valuable historical artifact.",

The principal Buddha is depicted seated on a square lion throne, flanked by two majestic lions, and is believed to hold the varada (granting wishes) and abhaya (fearlessness) mudras. The triad composition, with the Buddha and attendants sharing a single mandorla, was widely popular around the mid-6th century during the Three Kingdoms period. The square lion throne also reflects an early Three Kingdoms-era pedestal style. The right attendant bodhisattva wears a heavy crown adornment and luxuriant hair cascading over the shoulders, along with a pointed pendant necklace. The robes cross in an X-shape at the thighs, a stylistic feature that, compared to the more dynamic drapery of the early 6th century, appears softened, suggesting influence from mid-6th century Buddhist sculptural trends.",

      "content_en": "The White Paper with Gold Ink Brahma Net Sutra on the Bodhisattva Precepts (白紙金泥梵網菩薩戒經) is a Buddhist manuscript created in 1364 (13th year of King Gongmin’s reign in Goryeo) on mulberry paper. Gold ink was used to write the text within ruled lines. The second volume explains the Ten Major Offenses and Forty-Eight Minor Offenses. The depiction of the Buddha’s teachings aligns with the Avataṃsaka Sutra, leading it to be regarded as the culmination of the Huayan tradition. As a Mahayana Bodhisattva precept text, it has been highly valued not only in Korea but also in China and Japan.\n\nThe sutra is largely intact, though minor insect damage is present. The front and back covers have been recently restored. While the title is difficult to discern, the indigo covers and main text remain well-preserved. When opened, the sutra begins with an illustrative depiction (變相圖), followed by sections such as the 'Preface to the Brahma Net Sutra on the Bodhisattva Precepts,' 'Chapter 10, Part 2: The Buddha Nārada’s Teachings on the Bodhisattva’s Fundamental Precepts,' 'Methods and Preface for Receiving the Bodhisattva Precepts,' and 'Ritual for Receiving the Bodhisattva Precepts,' all written in gold ink. Excluding the illustrative depiction, the main text comprises 15 sheets, with the reverse of the first sheet left blank. Gold ink guidelines are arranged in six lines per page. The front side and the first three pages of the reverse have double borders, while the remaining pages feature single borders.\n\nNotably, the colophon (寫成記) at the end reveals that the sutra was transcribed in gold ink by Ji-am (芝岩) and illustrated by Mu-oe (無外) in May 1364. The patron was Gyewon (戒元), and the donor was Lady Lee of Gangyang-gun, who commissioned the sutra to pray for the repose of her deceased husband, Lee Jayu (李子猷), and their daughter. Additional ink notes indicate that in February 1595, a Japanese individual named Yang-i (良以) donated the sutra to a temple in Japan.\n\nThis sutra is significant for its exquisite illustrative depiction, near-complete preservation, and the inclusion of the colophon and dedication records, which provide details about its creation, purpose, and later enshrinement in Japan. The identification of the scribes and artists involved, alongside its history as a repatriated cultural heritage item, underscores its eligibility for designation as a national treasure.",

Approximately 80 years after his death, in around 1674, Kim Man-gyun led the expansion by adding a wing to the left side, and Song Si-yeol renamed the structure Yijidang. Jo Hyeon, Kim Man-gyun, and Song Si-yeol were connected through their shared regional ties to Okcheon and academic affiliation with the Gihohakpa school, which played a pivotal role in maintaining Yijidang as a jeongsa (study hall) after Jo Hyeon's passing.

Despite Gwon’s high-ranking official status, the portrait portrays him not as a bureaucrat but as a Confucian scholar clad in hyundanbok (formal dark robe), a style explicitly described in Gwon Seop’s (1671–1759) *Okso Go* as Song Si-yeol’s ceremonial attire. The striped patterns on the robe reflect the visual characteristics of the fabric used for hyundanbok during that period.\n\nThe portrait is mounted as a hanging scroll, crafted from a single seamless silk panel. At the top, the inscription 'Hansuo Wong Chilshippugye Jin' (寒水翁七十九歲眞) in bold calligraphy identifies the subject as Gwon Sang-ha at age 79. On the right mid-section, the notation 'Gihae Samil Il Hwasa Kim Jin-yeo Mo' (己亥四月日 畫師金振汝摹) confirms it was painted in April 1719 (45th year of King Sukjong’s reign) by Kim Jin-yeo (1675–1760), a royal portraitist. Unlike traditional line-focused techniques, Kim employed soft brushwork and subtle shading (seonyeom) to render the face’s convex areas with luminous realism, enhancing the three-dimensionality that effectively conveys Gwon’s stern character.\n\nThis portrait holds significant art-historical value due to its documented provenance, Kim Jin-yeo’s innovative adaptation of early 18th-century Western techniques, and its exceptional preservation.

Notably, the capstone is adorned with six realistically sculpted dragons—three on each side—twisting around each other as they compete for a central wish-granting jewel (yeouiju), exemplifying the ornate artistic techniques of early Tang Dynasty. The inscription is divided into two parts: Yuchun Yuan's family background and his life. The latter focuses on his military career after being recruited by Emperor Taizong of Tang, including his distinguished service during the 645 campaign against Goguryeo and his role in the 660 conquest of Baekje alongside General Su Dingfang. He also suppressed Baekje revival movements after the kingdom's fall. Later details of his life are illegible due to erasure.

This portrait has been enshrined for over 300 years at Hwanggang Yeongdang in Jecheon, with a well-documented history. Despite holding high government positions, Song is depicted not as an official but as a scholarly figure wearing a square-shaped sambanggeon (four-cornered hat) and a gray simui (scholar's robe), embodying his identity as a Confucian intellectual. At the top of the painting, the inscription 'Uam Song Seonsaeng Chilshipsase Jin' (Portrait of Uam Song Seonsaeng at Age 74) is written in seal script. On the right side, a hwasangchan (painter's praise) in regular script by Kim Chang-eop (1653–1722), a literati painter, confirms that he painted the portrait. On the left, another hwasangchan in regular script, composed by Kwon Sang-ha (1641–1721) and transcribed by his disciple Chae Ji-hong (1683–1741), provides further historical context. These inscriptions reveal that the work was based on a sketch Kim Chang-eop made in 1680 when he was 23, portraying Song at age 74. The painting is mounted as a hanging scroll on a single piece of seamless silk. It depicts Song in half-length, wearing a gray sambanggeon and a simui with black-edged collar and sleeves, his hands clasped within his robes. His face, marked by wrinkles on the forehead and around the eyes, and his graying beard and mustache, reflect his tumultuous life. While his long white and black beard is rendered with meticulous detail, his eyebrows are bold and dark. The face is shaded with yellow-brown tones to emphasize wrinkles and contours, contrasting with the clothing, which is outlined with thick, simplified ink lines. This juxtaposition of techniques captures Song's demeanor, spirit, and character. Though approximately 30 portraits of Song survive, this work stands out as it is based on Kim Chang-eop's original sketch and is considered a masterpiece, likely influenced by renowned portraitists of the time, such as Jin Jae-hae (1691–1769).",

Stylistically, this statue belongs to the same tradition as the Goguryeo-era Yeongga 7th-year Inscribed Gilt-bronze Standing Buddha (National Treasure), reflecting influences from Northern Wei Buddhist sculpture. While it shares a stylistic lineage with other National Treasures like the Gyeongmi-year and Sinmyo-year Inscribed Gilt-bronze Triads, its craftsmanship is slightly less refined, with simplified patterns and reduced dynamic form.",

Standing 131 cm in height with a mouth diameter of 91 cm, the bell features a gentle curve from the shoulder to the midpoint, transitioning into straight lines toward the base. The top lacks a sound tube (音筒) and instead has a single body with two dragons facing opposite directions, forming a ring. The shoulder is adorned with wave-like floral patterns, beneath which upper and lower sections are divided: the upper section depicts lotus motifs, while the lower section encircles densely carved Sanskrit characters. Four square-shaped lotus compartments (蓮廓) are placed below, each containing nine protruding lotus buds (蓮蕾). The bell’s body includes four distinct striking areas (撞座) and, between them, depictions of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva standing on clouds and holding a staff. A vine-patterned band circles just above the rim. This bell endured historical hardships, having been requisitioned during the Japanese occupation under the guise of 'donation' before being returned to Gapsa Temple after Korea’s liberation in 1945.",

      "content_en": "This statue is a granite-carved Buddha image located on a mountainside in Pyeongchon-ri, at the site of an ancient temple. Though the upper body appears short and the lower body elongated, creating a somewhat unbalanced silhouette, the facial features and drapery details are meticulously crafted. The head is adorned with small spiral-shaped hair curls, topped by a prominent usnisa (symbolic topknot). The elongated ears, extending to the shoulders, enhance the Buddha's serene benevolence, while the lips are delicately rendered as thin and small. The hands, clasped at the chest, cradle a medicine bowl, identifying the figure as Yaksa Buddha, who is believed to heal all illnesses. The robe drapes symmetrically from the shoulders to the ankles, with distinctive fold patterns: the upper body features narrow, parallel band folds arranged in regular intervals, while the lower body is divided into three U-shaped sections at the front, and concentric circular folds decorate the knees. These stylistic elements reflect an extreme formalization of techniques popular during the Unified Silla period. Notably, the knee folds resemble those seen in statues from the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla periods, such as the Samhwa-ryeong Maitreya Triad and the Yeongju Seokgyo-ri Stone Standing Buddha Statue. While the realistic facial expression retains elements of Unified Silla artistry, the rigidly symmetrical drapery, shortened neck, hunched shoulders, and upright posture suggest a formalized style indicative of early Goryeo craftsmanship.",

The temple was originally established during the Baekje period and later expanded into a full-scale Buddhist complex during the Unified Silla period. The Buddha's head features small spiral hair curls, and the face is slightly elongated with delicately rendered small eyes, nose, and mouth. The thin robe drapes over both shoulders, with faint curved folds on the abdomen and overall regular, fine parallel lines that appear somewhat schematic. The seated posture shows both feet resting on the knees with soles facing upward. The right hand forms the 'Earth-Touching Mudra' (降魔觸地印), placed on the knee with fingers extended downward. The pedestal comprises three tiers: the upper tier depicts open lotus petals, while the lower tier features inverted lotus motifs. This statue reflects the Unified Silla period's stylistic shift toward formalized details, particularly in the robe's drapery, with a noticeable decline in the dynamic vitality seen in earlier periods.",

The figure's hair is tied in a topknot, adorned with a recently crafted flame-patterned crown, while several strands flow down the front and back of the shoulders. The face exhibits balanced proportions, with harmoniously arranged eyes, nose, and mouth. The shoulders begin directly beneath the face, and the three neck lines (triline necklace) extend down to the upper chest. The robe features soft, flowing folds meticulously rendered even on the statue's back. Elaborate decorations grace the chest, and a belt knot is tied over the abdomen. The right hand, raised to chest level, forms the Amita Buddha mudra (thumb and ring finger touching), while the left hand (thumb and middle finger touching) rests in a similar gesture. Stylistically akin to the Gilt-bronze Bodhisattva Statue of Daeungsa Temple, this work is dated to the late Goryeo to early Joseon period.

      "content_en": "The Wooden Seated Shakyamuni Buddha Triad and Enshrined Relics, housed in the Daeungjeon Hall (National Treasure) of Sudeoksa Temple, include three wooden Buddha statues, enshrined relics, lotus pedestals, and a Sumeru altar. According to records, the triad was relocated to Sudeoksa by Venerable Mangong (1871–1946), a key figure in the temple’s revival, from Gwijungsa Temple on Manhangsan Mountain in Namwon, Jeollabuk-do. The central statue depicts Shakyamuni Buddha, flanked by Yaksa Buddha (right) and Amitabha Buddha (left).\n\nShakyamuni Buddha, as the principal figure, exhibits a dignified posture with broad shoulders, wide knees, and a slightly bowed head. The ushnisha (protuberance on the crown) lacks clear division but features central and top curls. The square face bears a stern yet gentle smile, with elongated ears reaching the shoulders and three distinct neck creases (tridhara). The robe follows a 17th-century style, covering both shoulders while exposing the right arm. The right hand forms the earth-touching mudra (lowered to the knee), while the left rests on the lap.\n\nYaksa and Amitabha Buddhas share stylistic features with Shakyamuni, including head form, facial structure, and realistic drapery. Yaksa holds a medicine vase in the right hand (thumb and middle finger touching) with the left hand raised, whereas Amitabha reverses the hand positions and lacks the vase.\n\nA 1639 inscription (Injo 17th year) reveals that seven artisans, led by Monk Suyeon, crafted the statues. The Sumeru altar beneath Shakyamuni, dated to 1308 (matching the Daeungjeon’s construction), mirrors Goryeo-era designs from Simwonsa Temple. Its hexagonal base, carved with vajras, flower vases, peonies, and cloud motifs, is a rare example of combined hexagonal and rectangular altar craftsmanship.\n\nEnshrined relics include sutras (e.g., Lotus Sutra, Avatamsaka Sutra), mantras, dharani texts, five-colored silk threads (symbolizing the five directions), and mid-Joseon period garments. The relic containers (huryeongtong) held five-colored fabrics with symbolic patterns (circles, vajras, banners). The preserved textiles and dyes provide critical insights into 17th-century Korean material culture.",

Two 1788 portraits inscribed '崇禎紀元後三戊申二月摹' were copied by Lee Myeong-gi, as documented in the Yeongdang Jikjeok. The text notes that one portrait followed the old method (gu-beop) to preserve traditional techniques, while another incorporated new methods (sin-beop) with three-dimensional expressions. Two bust portraits (front and side) lack inscriptions but are presumed to be by the same artist on identical silk. Comparisons with full-body portraits suggest they share dimensions and techniques with Jang Gyeong-ju's works. The Yeongdang Jikjeok, a manuscript recording the production history of Yun Jeung's portraits from 1711 to 1885, details four instances of copying, including schedules, quantities, and enshrinement processes. Yun Jeung's historical significance, combined with the artistic excellence of Jang Gyeong-ju and Lee Myeong-gi's portraits, underscores their importance as representative works of late Joseon art.

Revered as a sacred mountain since the Silla period, Gyeryongsan was designated as one of the Five Peaks (Oak) and received state rituals. During the Joseon Dynasty, it was designated as the central peak (Jungak), with Myohyangsan in the north as Sangak and Jirisan in the south as Hakak. According to tradition, the first ritual was held in 1394 (3rd year of King Taejo) after the monk Mugeuk Daesa received a divine vision. The altar was abolished in 1651 (2nd year of King Hyojong) but rebuilt in 1879 (16th year of King Gojong) under the order of Empress Myeongseong, who named it Jungakdan.\n\nThe complex is symmetrically arranged along a northeast-southwest axis on a hill, featuring a main gate, middle gate, and the altar itself, all aligned in a straight line and surrounded by walls. It strictly adheres to the formal architectural standards and techniques of danmyo (altar-shrine) structures. The plaque bearing the name 'Jungakdan' was inscribed by Yi Jung-ha (1846–1917), a late Joseon scholar-official. Inside, a wooden altar at the rear center houses a wooden box containing the spirit tablet and portrait of Gyeryongsan's deity.\n\nElevated on a 1.5m high stone platform, the altar measures three bays wide and three bays deep, with a paljak (eight-sided) roof. Its multi-bracket system (dapo), decorated with intricate carvings characteristic of late Joseon craftsmanship, supports the eaves both above and between columns, imparting a majestic and ornate appearance. Notably, seven sculpted figures atop each roof ridge reflect techniques traditionally used in palace halls, gate towers, and city gates.\n\nWhile the Sangakdan and Hakakdan altars of the Joseon period no longer exist, Jungakdan remains exceptionally well-preserved. As the sole surviving site of state rituals to mountain spirits, it holds significant historical value.",

Among the relics are 17 types and 504 items of printed and handwritten texts, including sutras, dharanis, a vow document, and an inventory list. Notable printed materials include the Saddharmapundarika Sutra (Lotus Sutra) and the Renwang Hoeguk Bancheo Baramil Gyeong (Renwang Protective Perfection of Wisdom Sutra), both annotated with 'gakpil' (wooden printing guides) and 'seokdok gugyeol' (phonetic glosses for Buddhist texts), which are invaluable for Korean linguistic studies. The handwritten documents, dated to 1346 (the 6th year of the Zhiyuan era), provide critical insights into the statue's creation, enshrinement period, and contents. Additionally, relics include late Goryeo-period clothing (a 'dapho' robe), well-preserved textiles revealing dyeing techniques and traditional colors, an eight-leaf container, bells, and beads. These artifacts collectively hold significant academic value across Korean linguistics, bibliography, Buddhist history, and art history, while also representing high cultural heritage importance.",

      "content_en": "The Triad of Sakyamuni Buddha from the Three Aeons at Gapsa Temple, Gongju, is a Buddhist painting created by Yi Gyeom (儀謙), a prominent 18th-century painter active in the Jeolla, Gyeongsang, and Chungcheong regions. Yi Gyeom's works, documented through paintings, records, temple documents, and votive texts, total 39 pieces, with 21 surviving paintings (30 works). His active period is estimated to span approximately 40 years, from around 1713 to 1757. This triad painting, measuring nearly 450 cm in length and composed of three panels, is one of only three surviving large-scale triad paintings from the Joseon period, including those at Unheungsa Temple and Hwaeomsa Temple. Despite the loss of one panel depicting the Assembly of Bhaisajyaguru Buddha, the remaining sections showcase refined brushwork, cohesive composition, and harmonious coloration, embodying the grandeur of the Buddhist realm. Dated to the early 18th century, it represents a transitional phase in Yi Gyeom's style, bridging his early and later techniques, and holds significant scholarly value. Additionally, the 1730 enshrinement records preserved with the painting provide critical insights into Buddhist ritual practices and the study of relic enshrinement in painted icons.",

This provides clear evidence of the sculptors (Seokjun and Gakmin) and the patrons involved, making it a benchmark for studying mid-to-late Joseon Buddhist sculpture. Active from the late 16th to early 17th century, Seokjun and Gakmin were influential monk sculptors whose works bridge 16th-century traditions with the emerging popular aesthetic sensibilities of the 17th century. Their disciples later dominated the Buddhist sculpture scene, underscoring this triad's pivotal role in Joseon art history. The triad also exemplifies the post-Imjin War (1592–1598) popularity of Śākyamuni Buddha triads alongside Vairocana images, with the vow document specifying iconographic titles that serve as a critical reference for future studies on Buddhist iconography.",

The repair was overseen by Song, a military officer (Changsa) of the Internal Secretariat’s Siheungwewi. This confirms the statue’s creation predates 1280.

      "content_en": "□ Location and Historical/Cultural Environment\nNogangseowon is situated southwest-facing behind a village nestled against the gentle slopes of Mount Hoam’s ridge extending from the northeast of Noseong. A stream curves in front of the village, with expansive plains stretching ahead, forming a 'wild residence-type' (야거형) layout. This spatial hierarchy in a flatland setting is characteristic of the Giho region. Passing through the Hongsalmun gate and entering the Sotdeul Oesammun gate, the grand lecture hall faces across the courtyard, flanked by symmetrical eastern and western halls, creating a scholarly space. Behind the lecture hall, elevated inner gates and a shrine form a ritual space, adhering to the 'front-learning, rear-shrine' (전학후묘) arrangement. The outer gate, lecture hall, inner gate, and shrine align on a single axis, with symmetrical eastern and western halls, showcasing a strict order uncommon in late 17th-century layouts. Notably, the three-part inner gate distinctly separates divine and human pathways, a rare feature.\n\n□ History and Architectural Features\n○ History\nEstablished in 1675 (1st year of King Sukjong) by Kim Su-hang to honor Yun Hwang’s scholarship and virtue, and educate local scholars. It received a royal plaque in 1682, later enshrining Yun Hwang’s son Yun Mun-geo, followed by Yun Seo and Yun Jeung in 1723. During political purges in 1717, the plaque was removed but reinstated in 1722. Surviving the 1871 purge, it remains at its original site for over 350 years.\n○ Architecture\nThe lecture hall, a representative large-scale structure in Chungnam, measures 5 kan (front) × 3 kan (side) with a front porch. The central 3-kan daecheong (great hall) has equal bays, while the side ondol (heated) rooms have wider bays. Four-panel curved lattice doors adorn the front, with two-panel partitioned doors between the daecheong and ondol rooms—a style seen in early 17th-century seowon like Sosu and Dodong. Built on a raised stone foundation with natural stone pedestals and slightly flaring columns, the structure’s height emphasizes its scholarly grandeur. The roof features a rare 'yeong' (榮) eaves extension, seen in Donamseowon’s Eungdodang, blending practicality with aesthetic balance. The bracket system (1-outtarget 3-ikgong) includes intricate carvings of lotus and floral motifs, with front brackets adorned and rear ones simplified. The five-bay roof framework enhances its imposing presence.\n\n□ Designation Value\nNogangseowon exemplifies Giho region Confucian architecture, retaining its original 17th-century layout and surviving historical upheavals. The lecture hall’s scale, bracket system, and 'yeong' eaves reflect technical and artistic achievements. The early 17th-century window designs and harmonious integration of grandeur and austerity underscore its significance as a cultural heritage preserving regional and temporal architectural traits.",

Dated to the late 12th to early 13th century, the bottle features a melon-shaped (gwa-hyeong) body divided into six facets with incised carving. The upper and lower sections are adorned with inlaid brain (noejeom) and lotus petal (yeonpanmun) patterns, while the central panel displays three types of inlaid designs within a lotus-shaped window: willows with waterbirds perched on branches, bamboos or reeds with waterbirds, and chrysanthemums, peonies, or mulberry flowers combined with waterbirds and moths. This innovative form and decorative complexity mark a shift toward heightened ornamentation in Goryeo celadon by the 13th century. The glaze exhibits uneven melting, pin-hole defects, and areas of clumping. Though stylistic differences suggest a possible chronological gap from earlier incised bottles, its co-excavation with other artifacts complicates precise dating, instead highlighting the coexistence of diverse celadon styles around the 13th century. The accompanying bamboo label (jukchal) bears the inscription 'Jun (樽)' and records its contents, confirming the bottle's use for storing sesame oil. The label is divided into head and body sections by a '>〈'-shaped groove, likely for attachment to the bottle. Its head is carved into a '∧' shape resembling a flower bud, with 14 characters inscribed: the front reads 'Jungbang Dojanggyo Omunbu (重房都將校吳文富)', identifying the recipient, while the reverse states 'Taeksang Jinsung Junbong (宅上眞盛樽封)', indicating the oil was presented as an offering.",

Their plump faces, swollen eyelids, prominent noses, broad philtrums, and gentle smiles with slightly upturned corners of the mouth reveal a compassionate expression. These features closely resemble the realistic facial style of the Bodhisattva statues from Wibongsa Temple's North Hermitage (currently enshrined at Gwanumsa Temple and Hyebongwon in Iksan), highlighting Won-o's distinctive artistic approach.

These works hold significant value as the oldest surviving examples of their kind. While rare surviving pairs of these banners exist at temples such as Tongdosa in Yangsan and Bongjeongsa and Bonghwangsa in Andong, most are incomplete.

The Five Guardian Deities and Five Emperors Banner comprises five hanging scrolls (chuk). The central, eastern, and southern banners feature silk in their centers with hemp added to the sides. The overall palette is subdued, with bold, fluid lines and harmonious proportions. The Four Time-Keeping Envoys consist of four scrolls depicting the Yearly, Monthly, Daily, and Hourly Envoys (Yeonjik Sajado, Woljik Sajado, Iljik Sajado, Sijik Sajado).

Dated to the late 12th to early 13th century, this artifact showcases a celadon bottle (maebyeong) with intricate incised lotus vine patterns and a bamboo label (jukchal) inscribed with historical details.\n\nThe bottle’s design closely resembles a 11th–12th century celadon maebyeong in the National Museum of Korea, featuring similar lotus motifs, including stems, petals, and buds, rendered in a clear, translucent grayish-blue glaze. Its elegant form, refined carving techniques, and vibrant glaze highlight the artistic sophistication of Goryeo celadon. Notably, the fine, shallow incisions depicting leaf veins and the use of pointed tools to create textured lotus stems reflect influences from Chinese Dingyao wares, suggesting a later production date than the National Museum’s example. This indicates that while the bottle’s form remained consistent over time, decorative styles evolved more rapidly.\n\nThe accompanying bamboo label bears 15 Chinese characters across its front and back. The front reads \"重房都將校吳文富\" (Jungbang Dojanggyo Ow Munbu), identifying the recipient as a military official. The back inscription, \"宅上精蜜盛樽封\" (Taeksang Jeongmil Seongjun Bong), reveals that the bottle contained refined honey presented to a high-ranking individual.

It was presented to Belgian priest Charles Meeus (known as Mae Yusil), a close acquaintance, with a handwritten message expressing the resolve for independence. The flag later passed to Lee Hye-ryeon, the wife of independence activist Ahn Chang-ho, and was donated to the Independence Hall of Korea in 1985 as part of Ahn's legacy. Measuring 44.3 cm in height and 62 cm in width, the flag is made of silk with a red and blue taegeuk (yin-yang symbol) and four black trigrams (geongwae, gamgwae, igwae, and gongwae) stitched onto it. The flagpole is attached to the right side, and Kim Gu's handwritten inscription of 143 characters in four lines, urging support for the Korean Independence Army, is placed between the pole and the trigrams. A small square seal reading 'Kim Gu' is affixed at the end. Historically significant, this Taegukgi vividly reflects the activities of overseas independence activists like Kim Gu and Ahn Chang-ho and the Korean people's fervent desire for liberation during the Japanese occupation. The inscription emphasizes the need to overcome the sorrow of a lost nation and defeat Japan, described as 'the waning might of the strong bow,' to achieve independence. This Taegukgi is the only known example from the late 19th to early 20th century with a precisely recorded production date, making it a critical artifact for studying the evolution of the Korean flag before the 1942 standardization by the Provisional Government.

Each king holds distinct symbolic objects: the Eastern Dhritarastra (Guardian of the East) wields a sacred sword, the Western Virudhaka (Guardian of the West) carries a treasure banner and jewel tower, the Southern Virupaksha (Guardian of the South) holds a dragon and mani pearl, and the Northern Vaisravana (Guardian of the North) plays a lute. Their fearsome expressions, armored bodies, and depictions trampling evil spirits underfoot are characteristic features.\n\nThis set of Four Guardian Kings, created in 1683, is a critically important benchmark for studying the chronology of such sculptures, as confirmed by an inscription found inside the Eastern Dhritarastra statue. Though the sculptor’s name remains unknown, stylistic analysis and the fact that the Dan-eung school crafted the Past Seven Buddhas and Thousand Buddhas enshrined in the nearby Yeongsanjeon Hall in 1681 suggest this work was also produced by the same school two years later.\n\nFollowing the late Joseon-era arrangement tradition, the Eastern and Northern Guardians are positioned on the right side of the hall’s entrance, while the Southern and Western Guardians stand on the left. Each statue measures approximately 4 meters, constructed with a wooden framework coated in clay, seated on a throne. Notably, the Western Virupaksha uniquely holds a treasure banner in one hand and an offering vessel atop a lotus leaf in the other, distinguishing it from the others.\n\nAs a late 17th-century clay sculpture, this set exemplifies the Dan-eung school’s signature style: elongated proportions, distinctive eyelids, gaunt faces with deep wrinkles, small noses, and innovative use of lotus motifs. These traits provide crucial clues for tracing the evolution of the Dan-eung school’s Four Guardian Kings style, seen in works at Jikjisa Temple, Mageoksaji, and Yongmunsa Temple in Yecheon. Academically, the statues hold significant value for understanding 17th-century Buddhist iconography, the activities and regional influence of sculpture schools, and the techniques and production sequences of Buddhist statues, warranting preservation as a national treasure.",

Approximately 25,000 celadon pieces and other relics were retrieved from the shipwreck, including this designated incense burner.\n\nThis celadon incense burner features a round body paired with a lid adorned with a lion sculpture. The lion is depicted with raised front legs, an upright tail, a bell around its neck, and a jeweled orb (boju) held between its front and hind legs. The lion's face is disproportionately large compared to its body, with meticulously rendered details such as an open mouth, teeth, and tongue.

The underside is adorned with lotus petals encircling the base, with intricate smaller leaves between the larger petals, enhancing its ornate design. The middle section is hexagonal, decorated with raised floral patterns. The lower section is carved with inverted lotus motifs that flow like undulating waves across the entire surface. Though following the stylistic conventions of the Unified Silla period, its lavish carvings and decorations suggest it was created during the transitional phase from Unified Silla to the Goryeo dynasty.",

This vertically oriented painting features Vairocana Buddha at the center, flanked by Manjushri and Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas on either side, with Ananda and Mahakasyapa disciples positioned above and below, forming a rare five-figure (O-jon) composition. The artists involved in this Gwaebul, including Chukmyeong, had previously collaborated on the 'Cheonan Gwangdeoksaji Three Realms Buddha Painting and Gwaebul' in 1741. Their shared stylistic traits include narrow shoulders relative to the face, pointed ushnishas (symbolic crown protuberances), round and plump faces for the bodhisattvas, and elongated ears. The painting's neat composition, slender yet proportionate human figures, and use of bright, soft hues like red, sky blue, and pink reflect the Buddhist painting traditions of early 18th-century Chungcheong Province. Pre-19th-century Gwaebul paintings of Vairocana Buddha are exceptionally rare, with most surviving works depicting the Three Bodies of the Buddha (Sakyamuni, Vairocana, and another form). This piece stands out as a unique five-figure composition and a key example of mid-18th-century Chungcheong Province Gwaebul production, offering significant insights into the study of late Joseon Buddhist art.",

The Daeungjeon Hall, the main Buddha hall of Gapsa Temple, was reconstructed shortly after the Imjin War (1592–1598) and has undergone multiple renovations to reach its present form. Historical records from the 17th century indicate that while the original main hall (geumdang) of the Silla-era temple was located elsewhere, the Daeungjeon was one of the first structures rebuilt after the Jeongyu War (1597–1598), retaining its architectural style thereafter. Key artifacts within the hall, such as the Gapsa Sojo Samseseul (Treasure No. 2118, created in 1617) and the Gapsa Samsin Gwaebul Tang (National Treasure No. 297, painted in 1650), along with the 1659 Gapsa Sajeokbi Stele, collectively confirm the hall's construction in the early 17th century.\n\nAs a 17th-century architectural specimen, the Daeungjeon Hall exhibits transitional features between earlier and later Joseon-era styles. Its scale of five bays (front) by three bays (side) is uncommon for the period, with simple proportional systems (8-cheok and 12-cheok units). The hip-and-gable roof (matbae jibung) features identical bracket systems (gongpo) on both front and rear facades, spaced at equal intervals—a characteristic preceding the stylistic trends of late Joseon. The minimal processing of curved wooden materials to explore new aesthetic possibilities also reflects emerging trends of the era. Sharing the prototypical form of multi-bracket hip-and-gable structures expanded in the 17th century, the hall holds significant architectural-historical value for its early influence on later Joseon designs.\n\nThe Daeungjeon Hall preserves well-documented historical records, structural elements (including bracket systems, roof framing, and ceiling decorations), and artifacts such as Buddhist statues and paintings that have coexisted with the building since its reconstruction. As a large-scale (five-bay) main Buddha hall representing a Unified Silla-era temple in South Chungcheong Province, it is highly valued for its architectural features and stylistic chronology from the 17th century.",

The fire chamber stone, octagonal with rounded corners, alternates between four windows and statues of the Four Heavenly Kings (Sacheonwang), deities who protect Buddhist teachings and symbolically guard the lantern's flame. The octagonal roof stone has sharply defined edges and elegantly upturned eaves, while the finial base is adorned with lotus motifs, though the finial itself is missing. Stylistically, the lantern retains characteristics of the Unified Silla period, such as the Four Heavenly Kings and roof design. However, the transitional square-to-octagonal elements in the base and fire chamber suggest a shift toward Goryeo-era aesthetics. It is estimated to have been created in the early 10th century during the Goryeo dynasty.",

The base (platform) is a low single tier, following the same style as the Jeongnimsa Five-story Stone Pagoda (National Treasure) in Buyeo. The tower body (taper) is constructed from multiple stone slabs for both the core stones and roof stones. The first core stone is exceptionally tall, creating an unusually proportioned impression, with faint pillar motifs carved at the corners of each side. The second core stone sharply decreases in height and width, featuring two door panels on its southern side, suggesting the installation of a niche (a chamber for enshrining a Buddhist image). This is particularly rare, as niches are typically carved into walls rather than having actual door panels. The third core stone is even smaller with no additional decorations. The roof stones are composed of flat stones arranged simply. A flat stone atop the pagoda may be part of the original finial, though this is uncertain. Dated to the mid-Goryeo period, the pagoda's base and roof stones reflect the stylistic influence of Baekje stone pagodas, indicating that Baekje-style pagodas continued to be constructed in former Baekje territories during the Goryeo era. While the disproportionately tall first core stone and narrow base reduce its stability, preventing it from being considered a masterpiece, its unique features and the insight it provides into the transmission of Baekje-style pagodas make it historically significant.",

The upper part of the foundation has a curved eave-like stone, slightly sloped with a low central platform supporting the tower body. This unique foundation structure, unseen in Unified Silla period pagodas but found in the Wolinji Stone Pagoda group, indicates a type originating in the Goryeo period.\n\nThe tower body, from the first to third stories, is composed of distinct stone arrangements. The first story is unusually slender, made of four rectangular stones without corner pillars. The second and third stories each use two stones with carved corner pillars. The first story's height and minimal reduction ratio in upper stories give the pagoda a strikingly tall appearance. All seven roof stones share the same form: narrow, thick, and heavy. Their upper surfaces are gently sloped with sharp ridge lines, and each layer has a horizontal eave with shallow drainage grooves and lotus motifs on the underside. The lotus patterns, carved in upward-facing designs (angnyeon), cover 16 panels (four per side) without internal decoration, creating an elongated effect that accentuates the pagoda's slender and towering silhouette. This lotus decoration, seen in the Silla period's Namwon Silsangsa Baekjangam Three-story Stone Pagoda, is uncommon in Goryeo.\n\nThe finial is missing, leaving only a single base stone atop the seventh roof. Classified as an atypical (irregular) pagoda due to its unique roof style, the structure's simplified stone assembly, crude carvings, and lack of stability suggest it was erected in the mid-to-late Goryeo period.",

      "name_en": "Daeungjeon Hall of Gaesa Temple, Buan",
      "content_en": "The exact origins of Gaesa Temple remain unclear, though local records such as the *Buan Hyangto Munhwa-ji* note that it was established in 634 (35th year of King Mu of Baekje) by Myeoryeon Wangsa, who converted a palace of Byeonhan into a temple. According to the *Gaesa Temple Reconstruction Record*, during the Goryeo Dynasty, National Preceptor Wongam oversaw a major expansion under King Sukjong. At that time, the temple complex centered on Hwanggeumjeon Hall, with Cheongyeongak to the east, Baekokgyo to the west, and Cheongheoru to the south, surrounded by a pond reflecting floral bamboo—evoking a paradisiacal ambiance. However, the current layout diverges entirely from these historical accounts. Today, the main hall, Daeungjeon, anchors the complex, flanked by Eunghyangak to the west and Eungjinjeon to the east, with Wolseongdae and monastic quarters situated off-center in the courtyard.\n\nDaeungjeon faces south, backed by Ulgeumbawi Rock, and stands on a double foundation. The upper foundation, composed of five neatly stacked long stones, is original, while the lower foundation—constructed with irregular natural stones—was recently added to lower the courtyard. The hall is a three-bay-by-three-bay dapo-style hip-and-gable roof building with curved eaves supported by brackets. Rebuilt in 1636 (14th year of King Injo’s reign) by Gyoho Daeseonsa, it underwent renovations in 1783 (7th year of King Jeongjo) and 1913.\n\nThe hall rests on natural stone foundations with round pillars. Between the pillars, a horizontal beam (changbang) is joined, and above it, a square beam (pyeongbang) supports the bracketing system. Uniquely, the pyeongbang is not a single piece but two joined with a tenon, a technique also seen in Woibongsa’s Bogwangmyeongjeon and Naesosa’s Daeungbojeon, enhancing structural stability against warping.\n\nThe hall’s distinguishing feature is its elaborately carved bracketing system. The brackets, with three tiers inside and out, feature realistic lotus motifs on the front. The capitals (judu) are lotus-leaf-shaped (hayeop judu), with three distinct forms: complex designs alternate in the central and intercolumniation brackets, while simpler ones flank the corner brackets, blending with traditional straight capitals. Though similar lotus capitals appear in Sungsimsa’s Bogwangjeon and Hwasa’s Geuknakjeon, Gaesa’s variety is unparalleled.\n\nAbove the capitals, brackets and supporting arms (salmi and cheomcha) interlock. The outer ends of the first three brackets are shaped like soffits, while the fourth, beneath the beam, is carved with vine patterns. The front brackets beneath the ridge beam feature dragon heads, contrasting with vine patterns on the rear and sides—a common practice of the period. The intercolumnar brackets’ unique design, with overlapping lotus-carved arms, resembles blooming lotuses, a style shared with Sungsimsa’s Bogwangjeon and Jeongsu Temple’s main hall, suggesting a shared artisan lineage.\n\nUnlike the front, the side and rear brackets use standard triangular supports, reflecting the emphasis on frontal grandeur. The front windows are adorned with floral latticework, a 17th–18th century trend seen in Naesosa’s Daeungbojeon, though originally they were simpler grilles.\n\nInternally, two central pillars form a rear wall, set back from the side pillars, with crossbeams spanning the main beams. Three-tiered ceilings create an illusion of height, decorated with dragons and phoenixes. Nine dragon heads from the front brackets and crossbeams dramatically frame the altar, accompanied by phoenixes with outstretched wings. The altar houses a triad of Sakyamuni Buddha, beneath a canopy (dapjip) with a gabled roof. Inside, coiled dragons, clouds, and wish-fulfilling jewels symbolize the Buddhist paradise.\n\nThis hall, through its lotus, dragon, and phoenix motifs, embodies the ideal Buddhist realm presided over by the Buddha.",

During the Joseon era, they housed spirit tablets of the king and royal ancestors, where monthly rituals (on the 1st and 15th) were performed facing the palace (mangwollye). The hall also accommodated envoys from the Ming Dynasty, posing challenges for maintenance.

      "content_en": "This portrait of King Taejo (Yi Seong-gye), the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, measures 150 cm in width and 218 cm in height. Originally, 26 portraits of King Taejo were specially preserved across the nation since the dynasty's inception, but only one remains today, housed at Gyeonggijeon Shrine in Jeonju. The portrait depicts the king wearing an ikseongwan (imperial hat) and a gonryongpo (dragon-embroidered robe), seated frontally on a throne, resembling the portrait style of the Ming Dynasty's founder. The angular contours of the robe and the protruding fabric at the legs are characteristic of early Joseon merit subject portraits. The elevated floor covering, used in royal portraits until King Sukjong's reign, indicates an archaic painting technique. The elaborate dragon patterns on the throne, also seen in portraits of King Gongmin of Goryeo, reflect a continuity from the late Goryeo to early Joseon eras. The ikseongwan employs colored shading to create a three-dimensional effect, while chiaroscuro techniques enhance the facial features despite the frontal composition. Though redrawn in 1872 (9th year of King Gojong) to replace the aged original, it faithfully replicates the prototype. As a masterfully executed frontal portrait—considered the most challenging composition—it remains an invaluable resource for studying early Joseon portraiture.",

      "content_en": "The Jeongeup Bohwari Stone Standing Twin Buddhas are two stone Buddha statues located side by side on a mid-mountain slope in Jeongeup, Jeollabuk-do. Dating to the Baekje period, these statues hold significant historical value as the southernmost granite Buddha images from Baekje and for their depiction of the 'bhikku-style robe exposing the right shoulder' (편단우견), a distinctive garment style. Though both statues share similar sculptural characteristics, the right statue is slightly larger, suggesting they were not intentionally created as a paired composition (이불병존상).\n\nThe larger right statue retains most of its original form except for a damaged halo (광배) and the lower part of its pedestal (대좌). It features a shaved head with a prominent ushnisha (육계, a topknot symbolizing wisdom), akin to the Baekje-era stone seated Buddha from Buyeo Gunsuri. The sculptural style aligns with other Baekje Buddhas, such as the Taean Dongmunri Rock-Carved Three Buddhas. A key feature is the 'right-shoulder-exposed robe' (우견편단), where the large robe (대의) drapes over the left shoulder, revealing the right shoulder, with visible monastic skirts (승각기) and lower garments (下裙).\n\nThe smaller left statue, missing its right arm, mirrors the same stylistic elements. The 'right-shoulder-exposed robe' style, which became prevalent in Silla during the late Three Kingdoms period, is evidenced here in Baekje, indicating its early adoption. The statues are dated to the mid-7th century, late Baekje period, providing crucial insights into Baekje Buddhist art and its regional influences.",

      "content_en": "Due to the lack of domestic records on the form of the Iksan Mireuksaji Gilt-bronze Incense Burner, comparative analysis has focused on Tang and Japanese animal-shaped incense burners. Among Tang-era Chinese examples, a 741 CE burner excavated from Gyeongsan Temple Site, featuring six legs and six animal-faced motifs, shows notable similarities to the Mireuksaji burner. The Mireuksaji burner appears to integrate Tang-era Chinese stylistic elements with distinct Unified Silla characteristics, such as archaic lotus petal designs and animal-faced motifs and rings akin to those found in the Sampulsa Reliquary. Additionally, the use of a gold-copper amalgam plating technique, identical to that employed in Baekje gilt-bronze works, suggests an earlier production period. While further comparative studies are needed, the burner is likely dated to the early to mid-8th century, a period marked by maturity in both Buddhist art and metalcraft. This hypothesis is supported by excavation evidence indicating the burner was buried no later than 858 CE. As the first confirmed Unified Silla gilt-bronze animal-shaped incense burner discovered in Korea, this exceptionally well-preserved artifact holds significant historical and artistic value.",

Large-scale clay statues of this era, such as the Vairocana Triad at Beopjusa Temple, the Vairocana Triad at Gwisin Temple, and the Clay Seated Shakyamuni Buddha Triad at Songgwangsa Temple in Wanju, were predominantly created in the early 17th century. These monumental clay sculptures reflect the Buddhist community's renewed status post-war and their determination to swiftly restore Buddhist icons destroyed during conflicts. Thus, this Vairocana Triad is a vital artifact representing the reconstruction efforts and shifting socio-religious atmosphere following the two major wars (Imjin and Jeongyu Wars).\n\nAdditionally, the ink inscription on the base of the pedestal not only details the triad's creation process but also explicitly identifies the three Buddhas as Vairocana, Bhaisajyaguru (Medicine Buddha), and Amitabha, serving as a critical reference for iconographic studies. The triad's precise creation date of 1633, along with the attribution to the renowned sculptor Mu-yeom and his disciples, underscores its historical significance.

The Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva statue was crafted in 1610 (2nd year of King Gwanghaegun's reign) under the leadership of the chief sculptor Won-o (圓悟), who was active from the late 16th century, alongside eight assistant sculptors including Cheongheo. Inscriptions on the votive records of the Two Guardians of Hell (Mudok Gwishang) and two of the Ten Kings statues from the same period mention another sculptor, Ingwan (印寬), suggesting his role in overseeing the production of the Ten Kings and attendant figures. Later, in 1646 (24th year of King Injo's reign), the chief sculptor Dosok (道賾) and six assistants created supplementary statues, including the Great Mountain King (Taesan Daewang), Guardians of Hell, lions, and child attendants, as evidenced by construction records. These findings confirm that the statues in Seonwonsa Temple's Myeongbujeon Hall (Hall of the Ten Kings) were produced between 1610 and 1646. Except for a few child attendants, the ensemble retains a complete compositional system of underworld iconography. It represents a seminal work of the early 17th century, led by Won-o and the newly identified sculptor Ingwan, who were pivotal figures in Buddhist sculpture of the period. Additionally, the later supplementation of missing figures like the Guardians of Hell in 1646 highlights the temple's efforts to restore the set. These statues are historically significant for reflecting the stylistic and technical characteristics of early and mid-17th-century Korean Buddhist sculpture.",

The depiction employs varied perspective techniques and strategic use of blank space to evoke the tranquil atmosphere of the region, surrounded by mountainous terrain and a river basin on the center-left. Jeonju Fortress, though placed on the center-right, is rendered with unprecedented detail, showcasing not only its walls but also specific structures like the guesthouse (객사), Seonhwadang (선화당), Dongheon (동헌), Jeonggyejeon (경기전), and Jogyeongmyo (조경묘).

The interior central wall of the reliquary is adorned with a repoussé depiction of Amitabha Buddha delivering a sermon, while the door panels display dynamic Vajra Guardians. The seven statues include Amitabha Buddha, Avalokitesvara, and Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva found at the front, and two additional Buddhas, Avalokitesvara, and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva discovered at the back. These statues share stylistic elements such as high ushnishas, large flame-shaped finials, slender waists, sensual body proportions, detailed craftsmanship, lotus pedestals with triangular upward and downward petals, disc-shaped earrings, and thick U-shaped necklaces. These features reflect the influence of Yuan and Ming dynasty Lamaism, which was prevalent during the late Goryeo to early Joseon period. The seven statues are divided into two stylistic groups: the Amitabha Trinity, which strongly reflects Lamaist styles, and four Buddha/Bodhisattva figures that adapted these foreign elements into a more localized Korean form. This discovery is invaluable for understanding the transmission and adaptation of Yuan-Ming foreign styles in late Goryeo and early Joseon Korea. Additionally, the complete set of seven statues found intact within a single reliquary with a clear provenance significantly enhances its historical and cultural value.",

It was used to issue imperial decrees to the people or appoint high-ranking officials. Crafted on September 19, 1897, by the master seal engraver Jeon Heung-gil (全興吉) and his team, this seal symbolizes the authority of the emperor. Jeon Heung-gil, active from 1851 to 1897, was a preeminent seal artisan of the late 19th century. The term 'Je-go' (制誥) refers to 'imperial edicts,' making this seal exclusive to the Korean Empire, as it could not have been used during the Joseon Dynasty. The seal was handed over to the U.S. Military Government’s Office of Public Information on August 15, 1946, transferred to the National Museum of Korea by the Office of Public Information on June 28, 1954, and has since been preserved there.\n\nThe production process of the seal is meticulously documented in the 『Daerye Uigwe』 (大禮儀軌). An office for seal production was established under the supervision of Director Sim Sun-taek (沈舜澤), with Hongmun Hall Scholar Min Byeong-seok (閔丙奭) inscribing the seal’s text in seal script. Over ten days, Jeon Heung-gil and other artisans completed the work. The 『Boin Busun Chongsul』 (寶印附訔總數) also includes detailed illustrations of the seal’s form, materials, and dimensions, confirming its historical use on official documents. These records underscore its high historical and documentary value.\n\nThe seal’s design features a dragon-shaped handle (용뉴, dragon knob) with scales, a pearl clutched in its jaws, and auspicious clouds (서기) around its open mouth. The body is covered in scales, with a perforated base for attaching a knotted cord (보수, seal tassel), though the tassel is now missing. Compared to Joseon Dynasty seals, which typically had turtle-shaped handles (귀뉴, turtle knob), the Korean Empire’s use of a dragon handle, a larger seal face (increasing by approximately 2 cm per side), and the adoption of small seal script (소전) instead of the Joseon-era nine-fold seal script (구첩전문) reflect distinct imperial aesthetics. The seal’s base (유대, handle base) further distinguishes it from earlier designs.\n\nAs a symbol of the Korean Empire’s sovereignty, the 'Imperial Seal Je-go-ji-bo' represents the pinnacle of craftsmanship, calligraphy, and seal engraving of the era. It also serves as a critical reference for identifying undiscovered imperial seals of the Korean Empire.",

Historical records, including the 1686 'Daeyangnu Yeokgi' and the 1760 'Manseoru Jungsu-gi,' document its transformation from a two-story pavilion to the current single-story structure, reflecting a late Joseon Dynasty trend of integrating pavilions as extensions of Buddhist worship spaces. This hall is notable for its exceptional scale, with a 9-bay front—rare among surviving temple pavilions, which typically feature 3, 5, or 7 bays. Structurally, the central three bays use main beams supported by front and rear columns, while the flanking sections employ crossbeams anchored to central pillars, enhancing stability and emphasizing the central space. A unique feature is the naturally split beam in the central pillar, intentionally utilized to create a dynamic, dancing appearance of the roof beams, showcasing harmonious integration of natural materials and architectural design.",

It is the largest known work of its era in terms of scale and quantity among arhat statues. Over 30 sculptor monks participated in its production, surpassing the number involved in the 1622 royal temple projects at Jasu-sa and Insu-sa (13 sculptors and 4 metalworkers). This collaborative effort reflects the work's significance. The ensemble employs diverse techniques of the period, including woodcarving, clay modeling, and polychrome decoration, showcasing the artisans' creativity and technical excellence. Notably, the integration of arhat and child figures into single forms demonstrates innovative craftsmanship, while the rare depiction of Yongnyeo Heonju (Dragon Girl Offering Water) in the Vulture Peak Assembly scene symbolizes the Buddhist ideal of universal enlightenment, holding profound doctrinal importance. The project was overseen by chief sculptor Muzam (無染), with teams of 1–4 sculptors assigned to different sections. Participants included members of the Muzam-Seungil, Hyeonjin-Cheongheon, and Suyeon factions—groups also active in the Jasu-sa and Insu-sa projects under the influence of the prominent monk Byeongam Gakseong (1575–1660). The ensemble also illustrates a collaborative system between sculptors and painter monks, as evidenced by gilding and coloring processes. Records confirm the involvement of sculptor Dan-eung (丹應), who later worked in Gyeongbuk and Chungcheong provinces, confirming Songgwangsa Temple as his early base. This work is critically important for understanding the organizational structure, artistic practices, and stylistic trends of 17th-century Korean Buddhist sculpture.",

While the Dongheon served as the administrative space, the Nae-a functioned as the private residence for the official’s family, collectively representing the three essential domains of a magistrate’s daily life: work, leisure, and residence. These three spaces are interconnected yet maintain distinct zones.\n\n- The Dongheon, destroyed during the Imjin and Byeongja Wars, was rebuilt in 1699 by Magistrate Lee Se-seong (李世晟) and named Sachilheon (事七軒), surviving to this day.\n- Pigeumgak, a nu-gak pavilion built in 1633 by Magistrate Jeong Hong-myeong (鄭弘溟), is the only structure from the Gimje government office complex predating the Byeongja War.\n\nGimje Nae-a features a 'ㄷ'-shaped layout. The central main hall is a five-bay hipped-and-gabled roof structure, while the wing buildings have three-bay pyramidal roofs. Analysis of the upper beam inscriptions and dendrochronology of structural timbers suggest a high likelihood of construction in 1749. Unlike the south-facing Dongheon, the Nae-a faces east to reduce spatial interference. The wing adjacent to the Dongheon mimics the layout of a private residence’s men’s quarters (sarangchae), protecting the inner courtyard while accommodating external relations. The opposite wing houses the inner chambers (anbang) and kitchen, serving as the household’s core. The application of internal-external spatial concepts on either side of the central hall is a distinctive feature of Gimje Nae-a’s design.\n\nThe bracket systems (gongpo) are minimally decorated, creating a rustic atmosphere, yet the use of full-length columns reflects formal architectural conventions. The main hall’s elevated pillars, large beams, and advanced techniques like floating purlins and bracket arms (podae-gong and ttunjang-yeo) exhibit sophisticated craftsmanship. The modular construction system, assembling spaces in 8-cheok (approx. 2.4m) units, highlights both advantages and limitations of prefabricated building methods. The main hall, a 16-cheok-wide five-bay structure, and the wings, 8-cheok-wide three-bay units, create standardized façades tailored to functional needs. This systematization reflects late Joseon-era advancements: improved construction productivity due to the wage labor system, specialized craftsmanship from divided labor, and efficient material procurement through emerging private timber markets.",

At the top of the bell is a dragon pipe (yongtong) that aids in sound resonance, and the dragon head (yongnyu) from which the bell is hung features a realistically depicted dragon clutching a wish-fulfilling jewel. The shoulder is adorned with a band of lotus motifs, below which vine patterns are engraved. Within the square lotus compartments (yeongwak), nine lotus flowers with protruding centers are arranged, appearing significantly flattened and stylized compared to the lotus buds of the Silla period. The body of the bell is decorated with a triad image, and the inscription below it suggests the bell was cast either in the third year of King Myeongjong (1173) or the twentieth year of King Gojong (1233) of the Goryeo Dynasty. The overall form evokes the Sangwonsa Temple Bell with its elegant lines, and it is considered a masterpiece among relatively large bronze bells from the Goryeo period, distinguished by the exceptional craftsmanship of its dragon head and intricate decorative motifs.",

Although not part of the original Tripitaka Koreana, this version was recarved from it, as evidenced by its book format (distinct from the scroll format of the original), early Joseon paper quality, and a publication record found in the *Golden Light Sutra Commentary* (보물), which confirms its derivation from the Tripitaka Koreana. The colophon notes that the woodblock calligraphy was executed by Jiang Mo (蔣모) in the style of Ouyang Xun, a prevalent script of the time.\n\nAs a publication by the state-operated Gankyeongdogam, this text reflects meticulous craftsmanship and serves as a vital resource not only for Buddhist studies but also for research on Korean printing history.",

These shoes, found intact on the feet of the tomb's occupant, are ritual footwear from the Baekje period, exemplifying the era's typical form and decorative motifs. The shoes feature a pointed, slightly upturned front, a flat midsection, and a rounded, narrowed rear resembling a boat. Intricate openwork carvings of dragons, human-faced birds (inmyeonjosin), twin birds, mythical beasts, and lotus flowers adorn hexagonal compartments. The soles are attached with 18 pointed nails (1.7 cm high) arranged systematically, and the interior is lined with silk fabric. Among approximately 19 gilt-bronze shoes excavated from Three Kingdoms-period tombs, these are the most complete. Compared to those from Naju Jeongchon Tomb, they exhibit early Three Kingdoms-era motifs like fish roe patterns (eojamun), suggesting an earlier production date. Structurally similar to the shoes of King Muryeong and Queen, they reflect Baekje's typical gilt-bronze shoe design—comprising a sole plate, side panels, and ankle flaps with spikes—and are presumed to be 'prestige goods' (weseppum) bestowed by central authorities to local elites to affirm their status. As a rare, well-preserved artifact of Baekje ritual footwear and a masterpiece of mid-5th century metalcraft, these shoes hold significant value for designation as a national treasure.",

It comprises volumes 4–6 of a seven-volume series titled 'Gaehyeoncho' (開玄褻), though only volumes 4–5 are preserved here. Printed on mulberry paper using woodblocks, the text measures 36 cm in height and 35 cm in width. It was re-engraved and published in 1461 (the 7th year of King Sejo's reign) by the Ganggyeong Dogam (刊經都監), an office established to translate and publish Buddhist scriptures into Korean. The colophons at the end of each volume list the names of scribes and proofreaders, along with records confirming its reprinting by the Ganggyeong Dogam. This copy, preserved at Songgwangsa Temple, serves as critical evidence that the Tripitaka Koreana (교장) housed there are not original Goryeo-era editions but later reprints based on the Ganggyeong Dogam's revisions, offering invaluable insights into the transmission and preservation of Buddhist texts in Joseon-era Korea.",

Historically, wind chimes were hung from the dragons' noses, creating gentle tinkling sounds. The bridge spans a tidal river, with its base nearly exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide.

The volume includes prefaces by Mongsan Deok-i, Song Emperor Renzong, and Zhang Zhu (장수), followed by the three texts and a colophon by monk Haengsim (행심), noting its publication under the supervision of Beopgong (법공) with assistance from Yun Seon (윤선). Two Goryeo-era editions survive: the 1361 version (without ruling lines) and a 1384 edition (with distinct ruling lines). The 1361 edition housed at Unheungsa Temple is the earliest extant print, notable for its excellent preservation and significance in studying Goryeo Buddhist scholarship and printing culture.

Commissioned by Queen Dowager Jasong (세조의 비 자성대왕대비) in 1482 (13th year of King Seongjong's reign), it was printed using movable metal type: the main text in Jeongchuk type (丁丑字, cast in 1457) and the commentary in Eulhae type (乙亥字, cast in 1455). Historical records by Han Gye-hee (韓繼禧) and Gang Hui-mang (姜希孟) at the end of the text reveal that the translation was initially ordered by King Sejong and continued by Kings Munjong and Sejo, though unfinished. Queen Dowager Jasong later tasked monk Hakjo (學祖) with finalizing the text, resulting in 300 printed copies. This work highlights the Joseon royal court's patronage of Buddhist publications from the Sejong to Seongjong eras and serves as a critical resource for studying early Hangul orthography due to its mixed script usage.",

Each body stone of the pagoda is adorned with double-layered diamond patterns, each containing floral designs, a decorative technique unique to Unjusa's stone pagodas. The roof stones have slightly upturned eaves and are engraved with layered sawtooth patterns. The finial consists of a cylindrical stone and a jewel wheel (寶輪), forming the pinnacle decoration. While the square faces of the pagoda align with typical Goryeo-era designs, the omission of eave supports and the unconventional decorative motifs on each face are rare examples. These elements exemplify the pronounced regional characteristics of the Goryeo period. As the tallest pagoda among Unjusa's structures, it was originally designated as a Local Tangible Cultural Heritage before being reclassified as a Treasure in 1984.",

      "content_en": "Cheonggwan Temple was founded by Monk Tongnyeonghwasang during the reign of King Jinheung of Silla. It was named Cheonggwan Temple because it enshrined the Cheonggwan Bodhisattva. Located near the seaside, the temple suffered multiple invasions by Japanese pirates, leading to a gradual reduction in its scale. Only the main hall, which once enshrined the Cheonggwan Bodhisattva, remains today. This pagoda, situated slightly to the right of the main hall, is a Goryeo-era structure consisting of a three-story tower body atop a two-tiered base. The base supporting the tower body features carved pillar motifs at the corners of both the lower and upper tiers. The tower body was constructed by stacking a single stone for each story's body and roof, with pillar-shaped carvings at the corners of each body stone. The roof stones have thin, four-tiered supports on their undersides, with a gentle slope that becomes more gradual as it descends. The corners are elegantly uplifted, giving a refined appearance. At the pinnacle of the pagoda, a square no-ban (platform) and a round bok-bal (inverted bowl) are carved from a single stone as the finial ornament. The pagoda exhibits a harmonious proportion, conveying a sense of stability and elegance. The omission of the central pillar on each side of the base and the thinning of the roof stone supports indicate a stylistic degeneration, likely a result of regionalization during the transition from the Unified Silla to the Goryeo period. Based on these characteristics, the pagoda is presumed to have been created in the early Goryeo period.",

The term 'Seokbo' refers to a chronological account of the life of Sakyamuni Buddha. Originally commissioned by King Sejong in 1446 (28th year of his reign) to honor Queen Soheon Shim after her death, the Seokbo Sajeol was translated into Hangul by his son Prince Suyang (later King Sejo) based on Buddhist texts. In 1447, King Sejong composed the Wolcheon Gangjigok as hymns corresponding to verses from the Seokbo Sajeol. The complete edition of the Worin Seokbo is no longer extant, making the total number of volumes uncertain until recently. Volume 25 of the Worin Seokbo follows a structure where the Wolcheon Gangjigok is presented first, followed by explanatory content from the Seokbo Sajeol. However, it does not replicate the original Seokbo Sajeol verbatim; instead, it incorporates revisions and additions from various Buddhist scriptures. This volume is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters partially missing. The first half (approximately 2/5 of the total) contains verses 2–4, while the second half includes verses 577–583 of the Wolcheon Gangjigok and content from Volume 24 of the Seokbo Sajeol. The discovery of Volume 25 confirmed that the Worin Seokbo originally comprised 25 volumes, revising previous estimates of 24.

Originally, these stone slabs formed the inner walls of the hall, though paintings now adorn the space. The slabs feature interlocking grooves at their edges, suggesting they were once fitted together to create continuous surfaces. Historical records indicate that many were damaged or discolored to a grayish-brown during the Imjin War (1592–1598), with approximately 9,000 fragments surviving today. The calligraphy, executed in regular script (haeseo-che), closely resembles the style of Choe Chi-won's 887 CE epitaph for Jingam Guksa at Ssanggyesa Temple, making it a rare and representative example of late Silla-era epigraphy.

The Western Vaisravana, wide-eyed and roaring, clutches a banner in his right hand and what is presumed to have been a jewel-adorned tower (boktap) in his left.\n\nMost Joseon-era Heavenly Kings statues don Chinese-style armor, distinct symbolic objects, and trample demons underfoot.

Discovered during an excavation survey of dolmens in the surrounding areas of Seoho-myeon Cheongyong-ri and Jangcheon-ri, the inscription consists of 21 lines and 118 characters carved in intaglio (sunken relief).\n\nDated to 1344 (the 5th year of King Chungsuk of Goryeo), this inscription predates the Treasure-designated Sacheon Maehyang Stele (1387) by 43 years and is 9 years later than the lost Maehyang inscription in Jeongju, Pyonganbuk-do (1335). It is the oldest extant Maehyang-related stele in Korea. The well-preserved state allows for the decipherment of most of the text, which records details such as the creation date, purpose, burial site of fragrant wood, participating groups, donors, organizers, and carvers. This provides critical academic insights into the Maehyang ritual practices of the late Goryeo period, where fragrant wood was buried to fund future Buddhist ceremonies.\n\nThe original text includes names of participants, such as the organizer Geok-am, donors like Kim Deok-jung, Kim Won, Shin Sang-baek, Kim Byeong, and Kim Sang-bang, as well as the carver Jin-am. The inscription reflects communal Buddhist devotional practices and serves as a vital historical record of religious and social customs from the 14th century.",

Featuring a 3×3 bay layout, it stands on a natural stone foundation with a gabled and hipped roof (paljakjibung). The front facade originally had elaborately carved flower lattice doors (now replaced with four-panel lattice doors with transom panels) before the Korean War. The columns, supported by large rough stone bases (deombeong jucho), exhibit a gradual tapering technique (minheulrim).\n\nThe bracket system (dapo) follows typical late Joseon methods: outer three-tier and inner four-tier brackets are arranged in pairs on the front and rear bays, with single pairs on the sides. The outer bracket arms curve sharply upward, while the inner ones terminate in ornate lotus bud shapes. The central bay’s interior columns frame two interlocking dragon carvings—a dragon’s head protrudes outward, its tail extending inward beneath the main beam. Additional dragon carvings face each other between the side beams, and the interior is adorned with lotus motifs, reflecting architectural traditions shared with temples like Naeosa Daeungbojeon (Treasure) in Buan.\n\nCross beams (chungnyang) with dragon-head decorations span the side bays, a technique common from the mid-Joseon period. The ceiling combines coffered and flat sections, with intricate carvings of fish and lotus patterns. This hall retains its original late 18th-century characteristics, holding significant historical and scholarly value as a well-preserved example of Joseon Buddhist architecture.",

The gentle slope of the roof stones and their thick, upturned eaves reflect characteristics of Baekje-style pagodas. The eaves lines are horizontal but slightly lifted at the ends, and holes for attaching wind bells are present at the corners of the roof stones.

The bell features a dragon-shaped canopy (yongnyu) with two legs pressing against the top plate (cheonpan), above which rises a tubular sound tube (eumtong). The shoulder is adorned with mouth-shaped motifs and lotus patterns, while a wide band beneath incorporates square compartments with lotus designs and smaller circles containing Sanskrit characters. The main body displays four square lotus compartments (yeongwak) surrounded by scroll patterns (chodangmun), each containing nine slightly protruding lotus buds (yeongroe). The lower band (hadae), positioned slightly above the rim, mirrors the upper band with lotus and scroll motifs. Inscribed on the bell are records detailing its recasting history. As a transitional work from large-scale royal-sponsored bells of the early Joseon period to temple-centered bells, it exemplifies the blend of traditional and innovative styles. The clear raised inscription and refined casting technique make it a representative example of 16th-century temple bells.",

According to legend, it was constructed in 1273 (14th year of King Wonjong's reign during the Goryeo Dynasty) by Monk Gomakdaesa of Muan Beopcheonsa Temple using mystical powers. The bridge measures 20 meters in total length, 3.5 meters in width, and 2.5 meters in height, featuring a flat deck supported by five stone piers. To the east, a 7–8 meter stone-paved road connects to a modern concrete bridge built to divert water flow. A distinctive feature of this bridge is its use of wooden joinery techniques, specifically the 'capital beam assembly method' (주두 가구법), typically employed in wooden architecture. The deck retains a 'well-plank' (우물마루) structure, illustrating its connection to contemporary wooden construction methods. Notably, the westernmost span was repaired with 'flat-plank' (널마루) flooring, showcasing a blend of historical and adaptive techniques. The foundation employs densely driven live tree piles embedded in the riverbed mud, overlaid with precisely arranged large rectangular stones to withstand strong currents. This robust design has allowed the bridge to endure floods for centuries. Additionally, the subaqueous base was reinforced with tightly packed wooden piles and a layer of rubble stones to prevent erosion. Dated to approximately 1390–1495, the Hampyeong Gomakcheon Stone Bridge is Korea's oldest surviving bridge of its type, retaining its original form and location. It represents a rare example of medieval bridge engineering and holds significant historical value as a testament to traditional construction methods.",

Standing 517 cm tall, it commemorates the lives of Doseon, a Unified Silla-era monk, and Sumi, a Joseon-era Seon master. The stele’s base (탑구) is constructed from flat stone slabs, forming a hexagonal shape with a square front and a 'ㅅ'-shaped rear resembling the tortoise pedestal. The tortoise’s head is slightly turned right, clutching a wish-pearl with 16 teeth (8 upper, 8 lower). Its large nose, round bulging eyes, and tail curling to touch the left thigh are distinctively carved. The shell features parallel diagonal lines instead of traditional tortoise patterns, with the front paws having five toes and the rear paws three. The stele body, uniquely made of marble, bears inscriptions in seal script: 「월출산도갑사도선국사수미대선사비명」 on the top and 「월출산도갑사도선국사수미대선사비명병서」 horizontally at the center. The text reveals the original stele was damaged and rebuilt. Notably, three separate inscriptions (two on the front, one on the back) were authored by Lee Kyung-seok, Lee Su-in, and Jeong Du-gyeong, all dated to the 4th month of the Byeongja year (1636) of the Chongzhen era, with construction completed in 1653 (4th year of King Hyojong’s reign). The sides of the stele body are adorned with dynamic cloud-and-dragon motifs (운룡문), carved in high relief to evoke the illusion of twin dragons ascending through clouds.

Vairochana’s mandorla (halo) resembles a keyhole shape, and his serene facial features, broad knees, and elaborate floral patterns on his purple robe (decorated with green and pink) convey stability and vitality.  \n\nThe left panel, depicting Niranjana Buddha (Sambhogakaya), shows the Buddha in a preaching gesture, crowned and adorned with jewelry. Surrounding figures include eight bodhisattvas, two Heavenly Kings, four transcendent Buddhas, three warrior deities, and four *Vajra* guardians. The circular mandorla and ornate accessories emphasize the bodhisattva-like elegance of this form.  \n\nThe right panel, illustrating Shakyamuni Buddha (Nirmanakaya), features the Buddha with a large keyhole-shaped mandorla and a *Bhumisparsha mudra* (earth-touching gesture). Below him are six bodhisattvas (including Manjusri and Samantabhadra), two Heavenly Kings, and above, ten principal disciples (including Mahakashyapa and Ananda), four *Vajra* guardians, three warrior deities, and dragon king and princess figures.  \n\nPainted in the 18th century by monk-artist Uigyeom and 13 assistants active in the Jogyesan region, this triad is noted for its delicate brushwork and predominant use of green pigments. Spanning over 4 meters in length, it is a rare complete representation of the three Buddhas and, alongside Tongdosa Daegwangmyeongjeon Samsinbuldo (Treasure), exemplifies the quintessential style of 18th-century Korean Buddhist triad paintings.\"\n}",

This adherence to the Lotus Sutra's narrative distinguishes it as a representative Vulture Peak Assembly painting. \n\nThe Eight Scenes are as follows: \n1. **Descent from Tushita Heaven on a White Elephant** (Tushita Heaven to the human realm), \n2. **Birth from Queen Maya's Side** (Lumbini Garden), \n3. **Outing and Contemplation of Suffering** (Siddhartha's realization of life's transience), \n4. **Great Departure** (renouncing royal life despite parental opposition), \n5. **Ascetic Practice in the Snow Mountains** (meditation with sages), \n6. **Overcoming Mara's Temptations** (defying worldly distractions during asceticism), \n7. **First Sermon at Deer Park** (proclaiming the Dharma), \n8. **Parinirvana under the Sala Trees** (final passing). \n\nExecuted on a ochre base with dominant red and green tones, the paintings evoke a heavy, somber atmosphere. The Eight Scenes reflect early compositional simplicity, naturalistic tree rendering, and spacious landscape arrangements, offering valuable insights into contemporary or earlier secular painting techniques. Both works are critically acclaimed for their religious fidelity and artistic merit.",

It serves as a crucial resource for understanding not only the style of the enshrined statue but also the architectural trends of the period. This gilt-bronze Buddha shrine, standing 43.3 cm tall, features sliding doors covering the entire front, allowing access only during rituals or worship. Inside the doors, intricately carved standing Inwang (Guardian King) figures holding swords are depicted with dynamic realism. The central front wall showcases a relief of the Vairocana Buddha Triad surrounded by the Ten Great Disciples. The Vairocana Buddha sits on an octagonal lotus pedestal, with hands in a gesture where the right hand clasps the left index finger—a typical mudra of Vairocana from the era. The face and body are elegant, and the pedestal’s refined craftsmanship highlights the shrine’s sophistication. The side walls and ceiling are adorned with vibrant floral patterns and delicate carvings, embodying the grandeur of the Buddhist realm. Opening the doors reveals two identical gilt-bronze Buddhas seated on lotus pedestals characteristic of the late Goryeo to early Joseon period. Though their facial expressions and bodies are restrained, the reliefs on the walls display fluid drapery and lively floral motifs, while the vigorous Inwang figures underscore the shrine’s artistic excellence. Historically linked to Monk Naong Hwasang’s votive Buddha, an inscription on the back records that the statue was crafted by Sinseung, the shrine by Kim Chi and Park Eo-san, with donations from the Park couple and participation by four monks, including Sin-eum. This shrine is iconographically significant for merging the doctrines of the Three Bodies (삼신불) and Three Periods (삼세불) of Buddha, while also providing insights into sculpture, painting, metalcraft, architecture, and patterns of the late Goryeo to early Joseon transition.

      "content_en": "Seodongsa Temple, a branch of Daeheungsa Temple (Head Temple No. 22 of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism), is located at the foot of Ungesan Mountain in Haenam. While the temple's exact founding history remains unclear, records from the \"Seodongsa Jungsu Sangryangmun\" (1870) and \"Seodongsa Jungsu Seo\" (1870) plaques discovered during roof repairs of the main hall in the early 1980s provide partial insights. These documents suggest the temple was traditionally attributed to the founding by Choe Chi-won (Go-un, 857–?) during the reign of Queen Jinseong of Silla (887–896), though this cannot be confirmed. The temple was destroyed during the Japanese invasions of 1592–1598 and rebuilt in 1779, followed by a major restoration in 1780 led by Monk Ui-yun and three other monks.\n\nThe triad's creation and restoration history is documented in founding and repair vows recovered during a theft incident around 20 years ago. According to these records, the Wooden Seated Sakyamuni Buddha Triad was crafted in winter 1650 (Qing Shunzhi 8, 1st year of King Hyojong) under the supervision of Monk Okbo, with eight sculptor monks including Unhye. The statues were gilded 154 years later in 1804 (4th year of King Sunjo) by 19 monk-artists led by Punggyesunjung.\n\nSculptor Unhye, who succeeded the tradition of Suyeon (active early 17th century), developed a distinctive style characterized by bold, robust forms. This triad represents one of his earliest extant works, offering critical insights into 17th-century Buddhist sculpture and restoration practices.\n\nThe triad follows a spatial triad format: Central Sakyamuni Buddha (symbolizing the Sahā World) is flanked by Bhaisajyaguru (east, Moonlight World) and Amitabha (west, Sukhāvatī). This configuration, alongside the Vairocana triad, gained popularity in post-17th century Joseon, likely due to the practical need to consolidate diverse Buddhist iconography in a single hall after wartime destructions.\n\nAll three statues employ the *joint-construction method*. The central Sakyamuni wears a modified monk's robe (left shoulder covered), seated on an octagonal pedestal with a lotus base. His rounded head features densely attached spiral hair, with a prominent crescent-shaped central dot (urna) and subtle usnīṣa. The face, with a pointed chin, sharply protruding nose, and tightly closed lips, conveys a stern yet individualistic aura. The elongated ear lobes, carved with deep grooves, reflect Unhye's signature style.\n\nThe robe's exaggerated collar folds create an unnatural, hunched appearance, contrasting with the simplified upper body and dynamic lower drapery. The rhythmic Ω-shaped folds and pouch-like creases near the left knee are distinctive. The earth-touching mudra (right hand) and \"well\" (井)-patterned palm prints are recurring motifs in Unhye's works.\n\nThe attendant Bhaisajyaguru and Amitabha differ in their double-robe style and hand gestures. Amitabha forms the dhyāna mudra (thumb and index finger joined), while Bhaisajyaguru holds a medicinal symbol in his left palm. Their elongated fingers and \"well\"-patterned palms mirror the central figure, though their drapery retains the same thick collar folds. This differentiation between the central and attendant statues—common in 17th-century triads—highlights Unhye's artistic evolution and the era's iconographic conventions.\n\nAs the earliest known work by Unhye, this triad is a vital reference for studying 17th-century Buddhist sculpture and gilding techniques.",

The ensemble exemplifies the sculptural style of Unhye, a prominent late 17th-century artisan active in Jeolla Province, who inherited the tradition of Suyeon (守衍) and Yeongcheol (靈哲) and influenced later sculptors like Gyeongrim (敬林). Characterized by robust, three-dimensional forms and bold, weighty lines, the works retain well-preserved polychrome patterns, offering critical insights into late Joseon Buddhist sculpture and pigment techniques.\n\nThe ensemble’s underworld-themed sculptures (명계조각) strikingly balance religious solemnity with the popular simplicity sought by 17th-century Buddhist artisans. As the only dated work (1667) among Unhye’s attributed pieces, it provides a key reference for estimating the creation dates of other undated ensembles, such as those at Haenam Daeheungsa, Gangjin Baekryeonsa, Haenam Mihwangsa, Suncheon Donghwasa, and Suncheon Jeonghyesa.

This layout creates a harmonious yet informal spatial arrangement, contrasting with the rigid symmetry of traditional temple designs.\n\nThe southern precinct (Namwon) centers on Cheonbuljeon Hall, flanked by Yonghwadang (former lecture hall), Gahero (gate pavilion), Bonghyang-gak, Donggukseonwon (meditation hall), and administrative buildings. To the east of Namwon lies Pyochungsa Shrine, auxiliary structures, and the relics museum, with the Daegwangmyeongjeon area forming a separate compound behind.\n\nCheonbuljeon Hall, rebuilt in 1813, serves as the focal point of Namwon. Accessed through the central gate of Gahero—a modest five-bay single-story match-roof building—visitors enter a courtyard facing the hall, which stands elevated on a high stone platform. Bonghyang-gak to the left and Yonghwadang to the right enclose the space, creating an intimate yet dignified atmosphere. Though smaller than the courtyard of Daeungjeon, the proportions of Cheonbuljeon (a three-bay by three-bay hipped-and-gabled structure with purlin-bracket system) are meticulously scaled to the site, reflecting its status as Namwon’s ceremonial heart.\n\nHistorical records, including *Japan Pyohaerok (Driftwood Log of Japan, 1821)* by Punggye Hyeonjeong, document the hall’s reconstruction and the enshrinement of its thousand Buddha statues. Architecturally, Cheonbuljeon exemplifies rational design for housing Buddhist imagery, with balanced proportions, bracket arrangements, and ceiling structures. Its comb and well ceilings, intricate woodwork, and windows display elaborate yet restrained ornamentation, while its structural integrity remains robust. These features align with techniques seen in nearby National Treasures: Mihwangsa Temple’s Daeungjeon (1754), Bulgapsa Temple’s Daeungjeon (1764), and Bulhwisa Temple’s Daeungjeon (1808), underscoring its comparative scholarly value.\n\nAs a rare surviving example of a Cheonbuljeon (Thousand Buddha Hall) in Korea, the building is recognized for its historical significance, architectural craftsmanship, and academic importance, warranting designation as a National Treasure.",

      "content_en": "The mural paintings of Guanyin Bodhisattva and Bodhidharma on the east and west walls inside Daeungjeon Hall (Geungnakjeon) of Daewonsa Temple in Boseong are exceptional examples of late Joseon-period Buddhist murals. The west wall depicts Guanyin Bodhisattva seated on a lotus throne amid waves, against a backdrop of rocky cliffs and bamboo, accompanied by Sudhana (Seonja Dongja) holding a blue bird (Cheongjo) behind the deity. The east wall portrays Bodhidharma and his disciple Huike, with Bodhidharma emphasized through a larger scale compared to the smaller figure of Huike, highlighting the legendary story of Huike's severe winter vigil. Historical records from a plaque at Daewonsa, titled 『Records of the Reconstruction and Repainting of Daebeopdang Hall, Ten Kings Hall, and Other Structures at Daewonsa Temple on Cheonbongsan Mountain in Boseong』 (1766–1767), suggest these murals were created during the hall's renovation. These works are significant as they follow the stylistic lineage of Unmunsa Temple's Guanyin and Bodhidharma murals and reflect the characteristics of the Uigyeom school, active in Jeollanam-do during the mid-to-late 18th century.",

It exemplifies how Uigyeom's mid-18th-century techniques were inherited and developed by his disciples. The vibrant red and green hues are balanced with softer tones of white, ochre, light green, and brown, showcasing a refined color application method.

Its significance lies in the following aspects:  \n\n1. **Clear Provenance and Dating**: Unlike most designated cultural heritage gyehoedo paintings, this work has a confirmed production date (1591) and identifiable owner, Park Ji-su (朴枝壽) of the Milyang Park clan. The inscriptions and historical records trace its lineage through generations, offering tangible evidence of its transmission and historical context.  \n\n2. **Historical Transmission**: Originally owned by Park Ji-su, a Saheonbu (Office of Censors) inspector, the painting was preserved by his descendants alongside his official appointment documents. It was housed at Chungyos Shrine until the 1990s and remains under the care of the Milyang Park clan, retaining its original ownership for over 420 years.  \n\n3. **Historical and Institutional Context**: The painting provides critical insights into the initiation rites (sinchamnye) for new Saheonbu inspectors in late 16th-century Seoul. It corroborates practices documented in Lee Jeong-hwi’s (李庭檜) diary and biography, illustrating how gyehoedo were mandatory for such ceremonies.  \n\n4. **Artistic Value**: The landscape and figure depictions reflect 16th-century An Gyeon School (安堅派) techniques, notably the short-line dot shading (dansun jeomjun) for mountains. The simplified portrayal of figures aligns with early 17th-century ritual paintings, making it a rare dated example for studying Joseon-era artistic trends.  \n\n5. **Preserved Mounting**: The painting retains its original 16th-century mounting, featuring indigo silk borders and yellow fabric, which matches the format of the oldest surviving gyehoedo, the 1487 *Twenty-Three Saheonbu Officials Gathering Painting*. This makes it a benchmark for restoring contemporary works, most of which were later remounted.  \n\nAs a pre-Imjin War (1592) gyehoedo with documented provenance, artistic rarity, and intact mounting, the Chongma Gyehoedo is a vital resource for understanding Joseon-era bureaucratic culture, art history, and material conservation.\"\n}",

The eastern and western lecture halls (Dongjae and Seojae) are situated outside the walls on either side, while the Myeongryundang Hall is slightly offset from the central axis. The educational complex adheres to the 'Jeondang Huje' (front hall, rear dormitory) style characteristic of Honam region hyanggyos. However, due to the limited site area, the Dongjae and Seojae halls are positioned unusually close to the Daeseongjeon, resembling the placement of Dongseomu and Seoseomu shrines in other hyanggyos. Architecturally, the Daeseongjeon's bracket system (gongpo) features a rare configuration in hyanggyo architecture, with false purlins (heotcheomcha) having curved (gyoduhyeong) lower ends. This creates spacing between the upper beams, distinguishing it from attached ikgong-style brackets.

During the 5th–6th centuries, large tombs such as Bokamri, Jeongchon, and Yeongdongri were constructed along the Yeongsan River basin. Among these, Jeongchon Tomb is archaeologically significant as it remains undisturbed, preserving its original burial state and comprehensively reflecting the culture of Baekje and Mahan from over 1,500 years ago. The gilt-bronze shoes, found nearly intact as a pair, feature a unique dragon-head ornament on the instep—a design unparalleled among extant Three Kingdoms-era gilt-bronze shoes. Recent scientific analysis by the institute suggests the shoes' owner was likely a woman in her 40s. These shoes share striking similarities with those excavated from Bongdeokri, Gochang, in terms of form, craftsmanship, and patterns. Constructed from four thin gilt-bronze plates (sole, side panels, and ankle flaps) joined with small nails and adorned with engraved motifs, they exemplify ancient metalworking techniques. The intricate designs, including hexagonal patterns, dragon motifs, human-faced bird (인면조신), mythical creature patterns, and lotus blossoms, reflect ancient beliefs in posthumous immortality and demonstrate exceptional artistic craftsmanship. Dated to the late 5th century, slightly later than the Bongdeokri shoes, this artifact represents a transitional phase in craftsmanship, bridging the gap to the 6th-century gilt-bronze shoes from King Muryeong's Tomb.

According to a founding inscription discovered in the Buddhist robes (복장) of the statues, they were created in June 1685 under the leadership of monk Sanggi (尙機) of Neunggasa Temple on Palyeongsan Mountain (八影山), Hongyang County, Jeolla Province. The project was spearheaded by the sculptor Seoknan (色難) and his colleagues and disciples, who were active in the Jeolla region from the late 17th to early 18th century. Seoknan, identified as a monk of Palyeongsan through inscriptions found in the wooden statues of Hwaeomsa Temple's Gakhwangjeon Hall, not only led the creation of these statues but also served as a patron for the statue of Mahakasyapa and participated in major temple projects at Neunggasa, including the casting of a bronze bell (1698), publication of the Seonmun Yeomsong Seolhwa (1707), and roof tile donations (1730). This underscores Neunggasa Temple's role as Seoknan's primary base and the significance of these statues as a major artistic legacy from his home temple. The ensemble is notable for its unique composition in an Arhat hall, featuring a triad of Shakyamuni Buddha, Maitreya Bodhisattva, and Prabhutaratna Buddha, alongside Manjusri, Samantabhadra, and the disciples Ananda and Mahakasyapa as the 'Six Great Bodhisattvas.' This iconographic arrangement, first seen in the 1624 statues of Songgwangsa Temple's Arhat Hall, became widely popular in the Jeolla region under Seoknan's influence. Though some statues are missing, the remaining pieces exhibit exceptional creativity in facial expressions, postures, attributes, and animal motifs on pedestals, reflecting both the stylistic traditions of his teachers Unwon (應元) and In-gyun (印均) and the innovative use of naturalistic elements associated with his other mentor, Mu-yeom (無染). As a key work for understanding Seoknan's artistic development and the lineage of sculptors, this ensemble holds great importance in the study of Korean Buddhist sculpture.",

Additionally, identical inscriptions on the base of each statue allow cross-verification of the documented records. Gyechan, a leading sculptor active from 1643 to 1671, trained under prominent figures like Eung-hye (應惠) and Seung-il (勝日), and this work marks his sole documented role as a chief sculptor.

While Sakyamuni assumes the earth-touching mudra, Bhaisajyaguru and Amitabha hold identical preaching gestures (joining thumb and index finger), a unique deviation from typical symmetrical arrangements. The simplified and streamlined aesthetic reflects a transitional trend in late Joseon Buddhist sculpture, bridging earlier elaborate styles with later minimalism. This triad holds exceptional historical, artistic, and scholarly value due to its well-documented provenance, intact original context, and representation of mid-17th-century sculptural evolution, warranting its designation as a national treasure.",

According to the biographical records in the *Goryeosa* (History of Goryeo), there was a custom in Seungping-bu to gift eight horses to outgoing magistrates. However, when Choi Seok left for Gaeseong after being appointed as a royal secretary, he returned not only the horses he received but also the foals born during his tenure. This act eradicated the corrupt practice, and the townspeople erected the stele to honor his virtuous governance. The original stele, built in the late Goryeo period, collapsed in the early 1300s, was destroyed during the Japanese invasions of 1597, and was rebuilt in 1617 by Lee Su-gwang, the local magistrate at the time. The three Chinese characters '八馬碑' (Palma Bi) on the front were inscribed by Won Jin-hae, a civil service examinee, while the reverse epigraph was composed by Lee Su-gwang and calligraphed by Kim Hyeon-seong, a Dongjisa official. The stele stands as a symbol of Sunchon's historical legacy, with its original 13th-century origins and 17th-century reconstruction surviving over 400 years. Its historical, artistic, and academic value, reflecting Choi Seok's legacy as a paragon of incorruptibility, justifies its designation as a National Treasure. The stele measures approximately 160 cm in height, 76 cm in width, and 16.5 cm in thickness, featuring a rounded top (bigae form) and a rectangular frame with folded corners. Unlike typical Joseon-era steles, it lacks a capstone and has a base adorned with lotus patterns, a motif commonly associated with Buddhist relics.",

This masterpiece is a late work by the sculptor Seoknan (色難). The construction of Gakhwangjeon Hall and the creation of these statues were pivotal projects in the restoration of Hwaeomsa Temple, with the hall's name being bestowed by the royal court, marking the transition from Jangyukjeon to Gakhwangjeon. The project involved extensive participation from King Sukjong, Queen Inhyeon, Crown Prince Gyeongjong (later King Gyeongjong), Sukbin Choi, Yeoninggun (later King Yeongjo), and influential families like the Yeoheung Min and Haiju Oh clans, solidifying its status as the largest royal Buddhist commission of the early 18th century. According to the newly discovered votive text, the seven statues were collaboratively crafted by 24 sculptors led by Seoknan, including Chungok (沖玉), Ilgi (一幾), and others. Notably, Seoknan led the Shakyamuni Buddha, Chungok the Prabhutaratna Buddha and Manjusri Bodhisattva, Ilgi the Amitabha Buddha, Ungwon the Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, and Chubung and Seoknan the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, while Chupyeong led the Prajnaparamita Bodhisattva. This highlights Seoknan's unparalleled reputation as a sculptor. Gakhwangjeon Hall, a grand two-story wooden structure, houses these statues, which harmonize monumental scale with aesthetic refinement. The triad of Shakyamuni, Prabhutaratna, and Amitabha Buddhas exudes solemnity with their robust forms and square faces, while the four Bodhisattvas (Manjusri, Samantabhadra, Avalokitesvara, and Prajnaparamita) flanking them display dynamic elegance, creating a contrast that enhances the hall's majestic and devotional atmosphere—a testament to Seoknan's artistic mastery. Iconographically, the arrangement follows the 'Beophwageobul' (法華擧佛) doctrine from the 1665 ritual text *Ojong Beomeumjip* (五種梵音集), making it the earliest sculptural representation of this Lotus Sutra-based iconography. As one of Seoknan's final works after four decades of activity, this ensemble exemplifies his refined technique and maturity, holding significant historical, artistic, and doctrinal value worthy of preservation and study as a National Treasure.",

      "content_en": "The Daeungbojeon Hall of Baekryeonsa Temple in Gangjin holds significant cultural and historical value as a key Buddhist structure. Originally established as the meditation site of National Preceptor Wonmyo Yo-se (1163–1245) during the late Goryeo period, the temple continued to serve as a vital center for monastic practice throughout the Joseon dynasty. The current Daeungbojeon Hall, the main Buddhist worship hall, was reconstructed in 1762 following a fire in 1760. Its heritage value is highlighted in three aspects:\n\n1. **Representative Example of 18th-Century Decorative Buddhist Architecture**: The hall’s bracket system (gongpo) features an external three-tier (outer 3-chulmok) and internal four-tier (inner 4-chulmok) structure. Externally, the brackets from the first to third tiers incorporate lotus-patterned angular brackets (angseo-hyeong), while the fourth tier uses water-wave-shaped brackets (suseo-hyeong) with lotus buds. The fifth tier ends with phoenix-head carvings (bongdu). Internally, the brackets are sequentially adorned with lotus buds, lotus seeds, and lotus flowers, crowned by phoenix heads. This bracketing style, formalized in the Honam region and later spreading to Yeongnam, places the hall chronologically at the midpoint of this architectural evolution. Additional features, such as the double-layered well-shaped ceiling (ungmul-cheongjang) without a traditional canopy over the Buddha statue, dragon and phoenix decorations, and the use of elongated brackets as internal supports, provide critical insights into regional and temporal architectural developments.\n\n2. **High Academic Value Through Extensive Historical Records**: The restoration process is meticulously documented in the *Mandeoksan Baekryeonsa Daebeopdang Jungsu-gi* (Record of the Restoration of the Main Hall of Baekryeonsa Temple on Mandeoksan). This text details the timeline of reconstruction, lists contributors by role (e.g., chief patrons, lotus-pattern carvers, blacksmiths, woodworkers), and traces networks of artisans and their influences. Complementary records like the *Mandeoksan Baekryeonsa Jungchang-gi* (Record of the Reconstruction of Baekryeonsa Temple) and *Mandeoksan Baekryeonsa Bi* (Stele of Baekryeonsa Temple), alongside the *Mandeoksaji* (Annals of Mandeoksan), enable comprehensive analysis of Buddhist architectural production within broader historical contexts.\n\n3. **Historical Nexus of Goryeo and Joseon Buddhism**: Baekryeonsa Temple is historically significant as the site of Wonmyo Yo-se’s 13th-century Buddhist community (Baekryeon Society) and a venue for Joseon-era Buddhist ceremonies. It was revitalized with support from Grand Prince Hyoryeong and saw collaboration between monks and Confucian scholars, notably Dasan Jeong Yak-yong (1762–1836), who compiled the *Mandeoksaji*. The hall’s plaque was inscribed by the Joseon calligrapher Wongyo Yi Gwang-sa, while its interior preserves assembled characters from the Silla-era master Kim Saeng. These elements collectively illustrate the interplay between religious, political, and intellectual spheres across Korean history.",

Each king holds symbolic objects: a treasure sword, a banner and pagoda, a dragon and wish-fulfilling jewel, and a lute, respectively. Their fearsome expressions, armored bodies, and the demons crushed under their feet are distinctive features.\n\nHeungguksa Temple, historically linked to Admiral Yi Sun-sin's naval forces during the Imjin War (1592–1598), underwent restoration starting in 1624 under Monk Gyeteok. The statues are dated to around 1645, following the late Joseon Dynasty arrangement of the Four Heavenly Kings: Jiguk and Damun Cheonwang on the right side of the gate, and Jeungjang and Gwangmok Cheonwang on the left.\n\nStanding over 4 meters tall, the statues feature a wooden framework coated with clay, depicting the kings seated on thrones. Their robust forms, square faces with wrinkles, and intricate patterns reflect 17th-century artistic styles, attributed to the sculptors Yeongwon and his disciple Ingun, known for works at Songgwangsa Temple.\n\nUniquely, the statues omit demons under the feet—a common element in other temples—and instead incorporate clay wave patterns on the gate's floor, symbolizing the temple's coastal location. Notably, Damun Cheonwang's foot rests on a turtle, a rare motif directly tied to Heungguksa's role as a maritime monastery and its historical connection to the Righteous Monk Navy.

The gate’s layout—comprising Iljumun (One Pillar Gate), Geumgangmun (Diamond Gate), and Cheonwangmun—reflects the sociohistorical context of the era while embodying the universal symbolism of boundaries and entrances in medieval Korean temple architecture, underscoring its historical significance.\n\nStructurally, the gate measures three bays on each side, features a double-eaved gabled roof, and houses clay sculptures of the Four Heavenly Kings (designated as Treasure No. XX on October 26, 2023) on wooden platforms in the side bays. The foundation and central passageway are paved with wooden planks (bangjeon), while the walls uniquely combine wooden panels and plaster.

The jointing technique between the main beam (daeleobo) and header beam (janghyeo) in the outer bracket is distinct—carved grooves in the beam’s lower section accommodate the header—while the inner bracket and beam lack such joinery, a method observed only in Hwaeomsa’s Daeungjeon and Geukhwangjeon halls, dating to the early 17th–18th century. Additionally, the use of tongpyeong-gode (a traditional eave-support technique) on the front and rear eaves provides critical evidence for dating the gate’s construction, enhancing its historical and academic value.\n\nAs one of the few elaborately decorated dapo-style Cheonwangmun gates rebuilt post-Imjin War, this structure showcases scholarly and artistic merit through its installation of brackets (daldae) and supports for the Four Heavenly King statues, alongside adjusted ceiling heights to conceal these elements.

The cylindrical torso lacks a distinct neck, and the hands are carved large—left lowered, right raised. Though the heavy robes give the statue a rigid appearance, the youthful facial expression and proportions convey a warm vitality. The left bodhisattva wears a jeweled crown and bears a serene smile, with a twisted waist creating dynamic three-dimensionality. The right hand rests on the chest, while the left holds a flask (vase), and a small Buddha image on the crown identifies this figure as Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. The right bodhisattva also exhibits a tranquil inner smile, with a robust body adorned with thick necklaces and bead decorations extending to the ankles. Celebrated for its masterful craftsmanship, the triad radiates human warmth while exuding an unapproachable religious mystique, and is regarded as a masterpiece of 7th-century Silla Buddhist sculpture.",

The stele commemorates his role in restoring Hwaeomsa Temple and revitalizing a devastated Buddhist community.

While sharing carving techniques with contemporary steles, it distinguishes itself through its bold and dynamic artistic elements, such as the dragon-headed tortoise pedestal and the forward-facing dragon on the capstone.

It has remained in its original location with its original form well-preserved since its creation. Its excellent state of conservation, combined with detailed records of its construction date, authorship, calligrapher, and contributors, makes it a critical reference for academic studies on 17th-century steles.

The name 'Mujangsa' originates from King Munmu's decision to bury weapons and helmets after unifying the Three Kingdoms, symbolizing his resolute commitment to establishing a peaceful era without war. This determination became the driving force behind the temple's construction and the subsequent erection of the three-story stone pagoda within its grounds. The pagoda follows the typical Silla stone pagoda style, consisting of a two-tiered base (kidane) supporting a three-story main body (tapseong). The lower base features corner pillars and two central pillars on each side, while the upper base is adorned with two circular 'ansang' (decorative motifs) per face. The main body comprises single-stone components for each story's core and roof. The first-story core is slightly taller, with pillar carvings at the corners but no additional ornamentation. The roof stones gradually reduce in size, with five-tiered supports and eaves that curve gently upward at the ends. Although the first-story core is relatively tall, the overall design avoids excessive simplification. The presence of ansang on the base suggests a later stylistic evolution, indicating the pagoda was likely built in the 9th century or later. Originally collapsed and damaged, it was partially restored and reassembled in 1963.",

The flame motif on the lid handle closely resembles decorative elements found on stupa finials from the late Silla to early Goryeo periods, suggesting a possible symbolic or functional connection. An inscription on the shoulder of the body records repairs made in the 21st year of King Munjong's reign (1067 CE), indicating the jar was likely produced earlier, during the late Silla or early Goryeo period.",

Though complete with a mandorla (light halo) and pedestal, thick layers of pigment obscure intricate details. The Buddha's head features small spiral-shaped hair curls and a distinct usnisa (topknot). The face appears disproportionately large relative to the body, with thin eyebrows, small eyes, a prominent nose, and a small mouth that lack harmonious composition, resulting in a flat, two-dimensional appearance. The robe drapes over both shoulders, revealing a diagonally folded inner garment beneath. The right hand rests on the knee with the fingertips pointing downward, while the left hand lies near the navel; both hands are small and crudely rendered. The mandorla is simplistically designed with formalized flame patterns along its edges. The pedestal, notable for its unique three-part structure, consists of a flat oval upper section carved with 14 lotus petals, a hexagonal middle tier, and an elongated hexagonal base adorned with 18 lotus petals. Stylistic elements such as the undergarment depiction and overall crude craftsmanship suggest this statue dates to the early 10th century, continuing traditions from 9th-century Buddhist sculptures.",

Their slender proportions and soft facial features suggest a later artistic style compared to earlier examples. While similar to the 880 CE Four Heavenly Kings from the tombs of Bojo Seonsa and Cheolgam Seonsa, they exhibit formalized traits such as larger dimensions and thicker drapery lines.

The broad, square shoulders appear sturdy and robust, but the chest is flat, giving the body a heavy, sluggish form. Though crudely carved, the intricate hands rest on the lap: the right hand forms a mudra resembling the 'earth-touching gesture' (bhumisparsha mudra), similar to the main statue in Seokguram Grotto. Previously thought to hold a round object in the left hand—leading to its identification as Bhaisajyaguru (Medicine Buddha)—a recent 3D scan revealed that the thumb is instead curled and placed on the palm.\n\nThe rectangular pedestal is draped with cloth flowing down from the front and sides. The rocky cliff behind the statue functions as a mandorla (halo), though it is physically separated from the statue. The plump yet rigid facial expression, formalized clothing folds, and flat body reflect the characteristics of 9th-century Buddhist statues, distinguishing them from the more dynamic 8th-century styles.",

Jeong Tak passed the civil service examination in 1558, rose to the position of Censor-General (Daesahun), and during the Imjin War (1592–1598), he served as Left State Councilor (Jochanseong), escorting King Seonjo to Uiju. Renowned for his expertise in astronomy, geography, and military strategy, he recommended prominent generals like Gwak Jae-u and Kim Deok-ryeong. He also intervened to save Admiral Yi Sun-sin from execution in 1597. His literary works include the Yakpojip and Yongman Mungyeonrok. The collection comprises 1 copy of Jeonggan Gonggyoji (royal appointment document), 1 scroll of Wiseong Gongsin Gyoseo (meritorious subject commendation), 2 volumes of Yongsa Ilgi (War Diary), 1 volume of Yongsa Japrok (Miscellaneous War Records), 1 volume of Yongman Mungyeonrok (Records of Observations in the Frontier), 1 volume of Imjin Girok (Imjin War Records), 1 volume of Seonjo Sijip Yumuk (Calligraphy by King Seonjo), 2 volumes of Yakpo Seonjo Yumuk (Calligraphy by Yakpo’s Ancestors), 2 volumes of Yakpo Seonjo Gancheop (Correspondence of Yakpo’s Ancestors), 1 volume of Seonjo Chogo Yumuk (Early Calligraphy of King Seonjo), 1 album of Giroyeon Sihwa Cheop (Poetic Reflections at a Retirement Gathering), and artifacts such as official seals, inkstones, and cases. These documents are invaluable for studying Joseon-era administrative practices, societal conditions, and the Imjin War.",

The statue features a usnisa (topknot) on the head and a distinct crescent-shaped motif above the forehead, a characteristic common in Goryeo-period Buddhist art. The rounded face, with arched eyebrows, elongated eye tails, a short philtrum, and tightly closed lips, conveys a solemn expression. The robe, draped over the left shoulder while exposing the right, is rendered thinly to reveal the body's contours. The simplified drapery lines, though less geometric and schematic compared to other Goryeo iron Buddhas such as the Iron Vairocana Buddha at the National Museum of Korea or the Danho Temple Iron Buddha (Treasure), illustrate the stylistic evolution of iron Buddha statues during this period.

Commissioned by King Injong, it was collaboratively authored by 11 scholars. By the 12th century, over 200 years after Goryeo's founding, the aristocratic culture had reached its zenith, and the dynasty was stabilized through a harmonious blend of Confucianism and Buddhism. This context necessitated a systematic review of earlier histories. The court, emboldened by victories over the Khitan and conscious of Jurchen threats, sought to reinforce national identity. Additionally, amid intense conflicts among aristocratic factions, the text emphasized division as a catalyst for state collapse, offering historical lessons for contemporary critique. The extant version, preserved at Oksanseowon's Cheongbungaek, comprises 50 volumes in 9 books on hanji (traditional Korean paper), measuring 22.4 cm (width) by 31.5 cm (height), with 9 lines and 18 characters per page. It amalgamates three distinct editions: original Goryeo woodblocks transmitted through Gyeongju, partially recarved in 1394 (3rd year of Taejo of Joseon), and supplemented with missing texts in 1512 (7th year of King Jungjong). As the earliest surviving official history of Korea, the Samguk Sagi addresses the Three Kingdoms period—a era with scarce sources—and set a precedent for later historiography. Alongside Il-yeon's Samguk Yusa, it remains an indispensable primary source for studying Korean ancient history, including the Unified Silla period.",

Later, Yi Hwang (Toegye, 1501–1570) was deeply moved by these works and, at the request of Yi Eon-jeok’s son Yi Jeon-in (Pen name: Jamgye, 1516–1568), transcribed them. Though Toegye’s preface on the tenth panel does not explicitly mention Yi Jeon-in’s request, it bears his signature: \"Written respectfully by the later scholar Yi Hwang (後學 李滉 謹書)\".

The preface, in semi-cursive script (行書), features smaller characters (under 4 cm) and exemplifies Toegye’s calligraphic style—dignified, elegant, and adhering to principled rigor, reflecting the demeanor of a Confucian scholar.

These inscriptions, mounted on scrolls, are presumed to have been received by Yi Jeon-in alongside the **Wonjoojam**. While Toegye’s large-character plaques (e.g., at Dosan Seowon and other historic sites) are often preserved as carved tablets, the **Sasangodae** scrolls are exceptionally rare for retaining their original handwritten forms, enhancing their historical and artistic value.",

The interior centers around a modest courtyard, with southern and western gates leading outside. While the southern gate was originally the main entrance, the western gate is now used, likely relocated after the demolition of an outer wing that once stood parallel to it. The house has notably wide and sturdy doorframes with multiple entrances. To the west stands 'Ssangsu-dang,' a single-story pavilion with a gabled (八-shaped) roof. The name 'Ssangsu' signifies the coexistence of loyalty (Yi Hong-in’s martyrdom) and filial piety (his descendant Yi Han-o’s devotion) within the family. Though partially repaired and modified over time, the house retains its humble, vernacular character, contrasting with typical aristocratic residences. It is situated against a low hill, overlooking the Pungsan Plain, and remains inhabited by Yi Hong-in’s descendants.",

Petroglyphs, also known as rock carvings, are symbolic engravings created by prehistoric peoples on sacred sites such as large rocks, reflecting their thoughts and aspirations. Globally, petroglyphs are linked to Northern cultural spheres and serve as key materials for understanding the origins and migrations of our ancestors.\n\nThe carvings include concentric circles, cross shapes, and mask-like motifs. The concentric circles, four in total, are triple circles with diameters of 18–20 cm, interpreted as symbols of the sun or solar deities. The cross shape, measuring 15 cm in width and 12 cm in height, is drawn within an indistinct square, resembling the Chinese character '田' (field), suggesting a representation of a tribal society's living territory. The mask-like motifs, ranging from 22–30 cm in width and 20–40 cm in height, depict facial features with hair and beard-like textures, likely carved as amulets or protective symbols.\n\nThese engravings are believed to form part of a ritual altar where agrarian communities expressed their faith and prayers to solar deities for bountiful harvests. Based on stone tools and pottery excavated from nearby Bronze Age sites, such as the Geumsanryeong Stone Age relics and dolmen complexes, the petroglyphs are dated to the late Bronze Age (300–0 BCE). They are invaluable for studying prehistoric religious beliefs, social life, and cultural practices, as well as contributing significantly to the fields of sculpture and art history.",

During the Imjin War (1592–1598), only Yeongsanjeon survived another fire, after which the temple was rebuilt and repaired multiple times to reach its present form. Eungjinjeon enshrines a statue of Sakyamuni Buddha flanked by Anan and Gaeup, along with sixteen Arhat statues.

Without a foundation platform, the stone base that once supported the danggan on top of the platform is also missing. Three holes were drilled into the inner sides of the pillars to secure the danggan, with the topmost hole uniquely shaped like a cross (十), a feature not found elsewhere.

The lower base is constructed from four joined stones, with pillar-like carvings adorning the corners and center of each face. The upper base similarly incorporates pillar-shaped engravings. The tower body’s corner pillars are also carved to resemble columns.

The building measures three bays wide and three bays deep, featuring a hip-and-gable roof (paljakjibung) that curves elegantly in an '八' shape when viewed from the side. Its roof is supported by a multi-bracket system (dapo), with intricately carved brackets placed both above and between the columns. Notably, the interior dancheong (decorative coloring) remains exceptionally well-preserved, showcasing high-quality Buddhist paintings on the ceiling, walls, and structural beams. While the exterior dancheong was repainted and lost its original appearance, the interior retains its historical form.

For three years from now, we pledge to uphold loyalty and virtue without fault. If we break this oath, we shall incur a grave sin before Heaven. Should the nation face turmoil, we swear to practice loyalty.

The military statues, characterized by their Central Asian or Central Asian-influenced features, are highly valued for their significance in illustrating cultural exchange between East and West. These statues inherit the realistic sculptural techniques of the stone figures from King Seongdeok's tomb, created during the zenith of the Unified Silla period, and are distinguished by their vivid, dynamic realism. Compared to the stone statues of King Heondeok's tomb, they exhibit a more lively and expressive quality, making them pivotal examples in the study of Silla sculptural history. Together with the idealized realistic sculptures of the 8th century, they serve as invaluable artifacts that embody the brilliance of Silla's cultural heritage.",

The rounded, plump facial features and naturalistic treatment of drapery reflect the mature Tang Dynasty (China) Buddhist sculpture style while exemplifying the sophisticated expressiveness of late 7th-century Unified Silla Buddhist art. These statues are believed to have been part of two sets—a triad and four bodhisattvas—attached to small wooden shrine structures for veneration. As masterful examples of casting techniques and craftsmanship, these statues are vital artifacts for understanding the international stylistic exchanges of the late 7th century.

According to the Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), Wonwonsa Temple was established as a Buddhist temple dedicated to national protection by figures such as Anhye and Nangyong, who inherited Esoteric Buddhism, alongside Kim Yu-sin, Kim Ui-won, and Kim Sul-jong. The East and West Three-story Stone Pagodas (approximately 7m in height) were restored in autumn 1931 by the Gyeongju Ancient Relics Preservation Society after having collapsed. The restoration is documented in Fujishima Heijirō’s article 'General Three-story Stone Pagodas of the Silla Period in Gyeongju,' published in the November 1933 issue of an architectural journal.\n\nThe two pagodas share the same structure and style, featuring double-tiered bases. The lower base corner stones, capstones, and upper base corner stones each consist of eight stones, while the upper base capstone is composed of four stones. Both upper and lower base corner stones have two tangent pillars and astral pillars. The upper surface of the lower base capstone includes a two-tiered support for the upper base. Between the pillars on each of the four sides of the upper base capstone are carvings of the Twelve Animal Signs seated on lotus pedestals. These figures have animal heads but human bodies dressed in everyday clothing, with robes fluttering upward.\n\nFrom the first-story tower body stone to the third-story roof stone, each component is made from a single stone. The first-story tower body has astral pillars and carvings of the Four Heavenly Kings on all four sides, each depicted in armor and holding weapons. The underside of each roof stone has five-tiered roof supports, and the upper surface features a two-tiered square support for the tower body. The finial consists of a noban stone (lotus pedestal) and an anghwa stone (inverted lotus), both of which remain intact.\n\nThese pagodas are estimated to have been constructed in the mid-8th century, based on their adherence to the general form of Unified Silla stone pagodas, the stone-carving techniques of the roof stones, the styles of the base and tower body, and the method of assembling stone materials. Notably, the pioneering placement of the Twelve Animal Signs on the lower base, along with their sculptural techniques, structural features, and expressive styles, grants them significant academic and art historical value.",

Above the principal Buddha, Venerable Mahakasyapa and Ananda are positioned against a backdrop of colorful clouds (yellow, red, blue, green) and an indigo sky, creating a sense of spatial depth. A prayer for the royal family's well-being is inscribed at the lower center, with the painter's record preserved along the bottom border.  \n\nDated to 1705, this early gwaebul painting exemplifies transitional stylistic features from the 17th to 18th centuries, characterized by a broad, solemn facial structure and slightly raised shoulders. Notably, it introduces a novel iconography of a Buddha figure holding a lotus branch—a departure from traditional bodhisattva depictions—making it a significant academic resource for studying Joseon-era Buddhist art.\"\n}",

      "content_en": "This Gwaebul Tang (large Buddhist hanging scroll) was created in 1702 (28th year of King Sukjong's reign) by monks Takhwi (卓輝), Beophae (法海), Seoljam (雪岑), and Seongjing (性澄). At the center of the painting, Shakyamuni Buddha is depicted prominently, flanked by Manjusri and Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas. The upper portion features the disciples Ananda and Mahakasyapa, shown only from the waist up in a praying posture. The attendants on either side are slightly overlapped, creating a sense of spatial depth and three-dimensionality. Unlike the conventional 'touching the earth' or 'preaching' mudra, Shakyamuni holds a lotus branch with his right hand raised to his shoulder. The inscription on the painting explicitly states, 'Enshrinement of a Portion of the Yeongsanhoe (Assembly on Vulture Peak) Image,' indicating that this iconography symbolically represents the Zen tradition's 'Flower Sermon' (염화시중) and the Joseon-era synthesis of Seon (Zen) and Gong (doctrinal) Buddhism. Notably, this work is the earliest known Buddhist painting to depict the Flower Sermon. The Seonseoksa Yeongsanhoe Gwaebul Tang holds significant historical value as a pioneering example of the lotus-holding Shakyamuni iconography and as a precursor to the 1705 Yecheon Yongmunsa Yeongsanhoe Gwaebul Tang (Treasure No. 1919). Its refined color palette and masterful brushwork exemplify the sophistication of early 18th-century Buddhist art in Korea.",

The statue exhibits broad, heavy knees contrasted with relatively narrow shoulders and an elongated torso, creating an overall slender proportion. Its distinct features include a narrow, conical head, a gaunt face with reduced volume compared to late Goryeo statues, a narrow chest, knife-like folds near the left shoulder, and Ω-shaped folds skewed to the left—traits inherited from the 1458 Yeongju Heukseoksa Wooden Seated Amitabha Buddha Statue. Additionally, sharp angular folds curving like a bow at the knees and protruding folds above the knees reflect stylistic elements common in early Joseon Buddhist sculptures, such as the Pyeongchang Sangwonsa Wooden Seated Munsu-bosalarup. This statue is a critical benchmark for early Joseon Buddhist art, as it provides clear historical records of its creation date, consecration site, and artisans. It exemplifies the integration of traditional Korean Buddhist sculpture with newly introduced foreign styles during the early Joseon period, earning comparisons to the National Treasure Heukseoksa Wooden Seated Amitabha Buddha Statue.

The artists involved were Uigyun (義均), Seokmin (碩敏), Seongik (性益), Jibung (智朋), Chehwan (體環), Kwaemin (快敏), and Samhak (三學), all of whom were painters associated with Donghwasa and Pagyesa Temples on Mount Palgong in Daegu. They were primarily active in the Gyeongsang region.  \n\nThis large-scale painting, measuring approximately 10 meters, uniquely depicts a solitary Tathagata in a bodhisattva form holding a lotus stem. It is considered Uigyun's magnum opus. Despite the simplicity of featuring a single figure on a vast canvas, the work masterfully balances harmony and contrast through the use of red, green, and blue tones. The intricate details, such as the gold-based green patterns on the Tathagata's kasaya (monastic robe) and the elaborate designs at the robe's edges, demonstrate meticulous craftsmanship.  \n\nThe iconography of this Gwaebul—featuring a Tathagata with a five-Tathagata-adorned crown holding a lotus—reflects a style popular in the Gyeongsang region from the late 17th to early 18th century. It holds significant value for studying the evolution of Gwaebul imagery during this period.\"\n}",

      "content_en": "This woodblock was carved in June 1219 (6th year of King Gojong's reign) at Buseoksa Temple. As a printed woodblock with a clearly recorded production date and location, it is one of the earliest surviving examples from the Goryeo period. Most extant Goryeo woodblocks, such as the Tripitaka Koreana (Palman Daejanggyeong, National Treasure) and Buddhist texts from 1236–1251, are religious in nature, whereas secular publications are extremely rare.\n\nThe content reflects astrological (seongmyeonghak) and Five Elements (obangsaang) beliefs, organizing auspicious and inauspicious days by month in a horizontal format for reference in selecting favorable dates (taeil). One side lists 11 inauspicious days, including 'Guchoil for Planting' (九焦日種植), with annotated explanations of disasters linked to violating taboos like 'Jangdansungil' (長短星日) and 'Cheonjiangil' (天地殃日). Notably, it suggests that performing Buddhist merits (gwangsu gongdeok) could avert misfortune, illustrating the syncretism of Buddhism with traditional cosmology. The reverse side catalogs 20 auspicious days for agricultural activities.\n\nDespite being a single sheet, this woodblock is historically significant as an early dated artifact with documented origins. Its focus on daily life practices offers critical insights into 13th-century Buddhist studies, bibliography, and folk traditions. The fact that Buseoksa Temple—a major Buddhist institution—published it under the name of a 'wontangju' (願堂主, wish hall supervisor) also highlights its role in proselytization through practical guides for laypeople.",

The temple’s topography features a north-high-south-low (北高南低) and east-high-west-low (東高西低) gradient, with harmoniously constructed stone terraces following the natural landscape. The eastern temple complex aligns Jahamun Gate, Daeungjeon Hall, and Museoljeon Hall along a north-south axis, surrounded by cloisters. The east and west sides of Daeungjeon Hall connect to side corridors (翼廊), while the southeastern and southwestern corners of the southern cloister feature Jogyeongnu Pavilion and Beomeongnu Pavilion, respectively. To the south of Jahamun Gate, the Cheongungyo and Baegungyo stone bridges provide access to Daeungjeon Hall.\n\n□ History and Architectural Features\n○ History\nHistorical records of Bulguksa Temple include Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), Bulguksa Gogim Changgi (Record of Bulguksa Temple’s Past and Present), and Daeungjeon Jungchang Danhwakgi (Record of Repairs to Daeungjeon Hall). According to Samguk Yusa, Kim Daeseong began constructing Bulguksa in the 10th year (751 CE) of King Gyeongdeok’s reign, with the state completing the project in the 10th year (774 CE) of King Hyegong’s reign after his death. Daeungjeon Hall was repaired in the 18th year (1436) of King Sejong’s reign, again in the 21st year (1490) of King Seongjong’s reign, and the 19th year (1564) of King Myeongjong’s reign. However, it was destroyed during the Imjin War (1593). Rebuilt in the 10th year (1659) of King Hyojong’s reign, it underwent further repairs in the 3rd year (1677) and 34th year (1708) of King Sukjong’s reign, and the 5th, 6th, and 7th years (1730) of King Yeongjo’s reign. A major reconstruction occurred in the 41st year (1765) of King Yeongjo’s reign, with dancheong (decorative painting) completed in 1767 and the triad Buddha statues and rear altarpiece finalized in 1769. During the Japanese occupation (1918–1925 and 1934–1936), the hall was renovated under Japanese colonial authorities. It was restored again in the 1970s under President Park Chung-hee’s directive.\n\n○ Architectural Features\nThe east side of Daeungjeon Hall features Dabotap Pagoda, while Seokgatap Pagoda stands to the west. A typical Unified Silla octagonal stone lantern is positioned in front of the hall. Daeungjeon Hall has a rectangular plan (5 bays wide × 5 bays deep) with a slightly elongated east-west axis, a hipped-and-gabled tiled roof, and a multi-bracket system characteristic of late Joseon architecture. The central bay (17.7 cheok) is over twice as wide as the adjacent bays (8.7 cheok for side bays, 8.2 cheok for rear bays). The multi-bracket system includes three space brackets in the central bay and one each in the side and rear bays. The bracket tails are adorned with grass-and-flower patterns and phoenix heads, while dragon heads protrude from the purlin supports, creating lavish decorations.\nThe central front bay has a four-panel floral lattice door, side and rear bays feature double-panel lattice doors, and the side walls have triple-panel lattice doors. The rear central bay has a four-panel grid lattice door, with side bays walled and rear bays having divided grid lattice doors; 10 of 20 bays are open. The foundation retains Unified Silla-era stonework with corner pillars (隅柱) and support pillars (撐柱), topped with capstones (甲石). Central staircases on all sides have triangular-patterned step stones. The ceiling is a layered well-type design, elevated at the center.\n\n□ Designation Value\nDaeungjeon Hall preserves original stone structures from its founding, including the foundation and lantern, atop which the 1765 reconstruction was built. It is a critically important architectural artifact due to its preserved reconstruction records and dancheong documentation. As a 5×5 bay multi-bracket hall, its interior spatial composition (omitting columns), decorative elements (grass-and-flower patterns, phoenix heads, dragon motifs), and elaborate interior-exterior design exemplify its excellence as a Buddhist hall, underscoring its historical and artistic significance.",

Originally named Daeguksa, it was renamed Daegoksa after being rebuilt in 1605 (38th year of King Seonjo's reign) by Tanwu (坦祐) following its destruction during the Imjin War. While some theories suggest its founding dates to the late Silla or early Goryeo period—based on artifacts like a gilt-bronze Buddha statue (dated to late Silla), a multi-tiered stone pagoda from early Goryeo, and Yi Gyu-bo's poetic references—the exact origins remain unclear due to the lack of surviving foundations.\n\nThe Daewongjeon Hall, the temple's main Buddhist sanctuary, is a three-bay-by-two-bay structure built in the multi-bracket system (da po gye) style. Reconstructed in 1687 (13th year of King Sukjong's reign) by Monk Taedjeon, it features a unique altar placement behind the rear column line, a layout that became less common in similar 18th-century halls, reflecting architectural trends of the late 17th century.\n\nNotable features include an engsengchang (twin-window) structure on the rear west bay, vertical wall lines without intermediate beams on the side and rear walls, and large holes at the base of the front and side columns suggesting a former side veranda. These elements are characteristic of pre-18th-century architecture. The hall's brackets (pojak) employ three tiers externally and internally, with evenly spaced columns and paired brackets per bay to stabilize the roof load, demonstrating meticulous structural planning. Structural components like columns and beams prioritize functional simplicity over decorative elaboration, with clear and concise joinery.\n\nThe hall's architectural significance lies in its historical traits: uniform bracket tiers, engsengchang windows, altar arrangement, and traces of a front veranda. These features provide critical insights into regional Buddhist temple revival trends and stylistic evolution in the Uiseong area during the late 17th century, offering substantial value for architectural history studies.",

It records the official recognition of Jeongjong's contributions to suppressing the rebellion led by Yi Si-ae (李施愛) in Gilju, Hamgyong Province, in May 1467. The edict was granted in November of the same year. The 'Righteous Military Merit Subject' title was awarded to 45 individuals across three ranks based on their merits: 10 in the first rank (including Lee Jun), 23 in the second (including Kim Guk-gwang), and 12 in the third (including Lee Bu). Jeongjong was listed in the third rank. Additionally, the 'Jeongjong's Military Examination Red Certificate (鄭種 武科紅牌),' issued in 1442, is one of the earliest surviving documents certifying passage of the military examination. It holds particular value as it reflects the transitional period in Joseon-era official document formats, shifting from 'Wangji' (royal decree) to 'Gyoji' (imperial edict).",

The walls differ slightly between the Daeungjeon Hall area (single-tier) and Geungnakjeon Hall area (double-tier). Notably, the walls harmonize with National Treasures Cheongun-Baegun Bridges and Yeonhwa-Chilbo Bridges, showcasing dynamic tiered designs and intricate stonework, including corbelled arches under the stone bridges. Despite deterioration over centuries, the walls retain their historical and artistic value, reflecting advanced Silla stonemasonry techniques. Designated as Treasure, they complement the temple’s UNESCO World Heritage status and underscore the architectural sophistication of Unified Silla.",

      "content_en": "The Pohang Jungseong-ri Silla Stele is a groundbreaking resource for the study of Silla history. Located only 8.7 km from the site of the Naengsu-ri Silla Stele, this stele shares notable similarities in its inscription content. Key parallels include records of disputes over property involving local residents, joint judicial decisions by Silla's ruling elite, and stipulations to prevent future recurrences of such conflicts. Additionally, the stele features comparable official titles, rank notations, and names of individuals potentially identical to those mentioned in the Naengsu-ri Stele. These elements underscore its immense historical and academic value in elucidating Silla's political, economic, and cultural landscape.\n\nNotably, this stele is likely the oldest extant Silla stele, offering revolutionary insights into the kingdom's calligraphic history. The inscription's unpolished and unsophisticated phrasing suggests that Chinese characters (Hanmun) had not yet become widespread in Silla. The script style also indicates minimal influence from Han or Wei-Jin dynasty Chinese calligraphy, instead reflecting an indigenous, vernacular Silla aesthetic. When contextualized within Chinese calligraphic evolution, the stele's script resembles early clerical script (Gorye) in transition from seal script (Sojeon) to clerical script (Yeseo), characterized by the absence of flourishes (pachek). However, it is fundamentally a self-developed Silla script, blending seal (Jeonbeop), clerical (Yebeop), regular (Haebeop), and cursive (Haengbeop) styles into an asymmetrical harmony. This 'formless' (mujeonghyeong) calligraphic beauty, marked by rustic charm and balanced spontaneity, exemplifies Silla's unique artistic sensibilities. The stele thus serves as a pivotal artifact for understanding pre-Unified Silla aesthetics and early calligraphic traditions, as well as the broader historical and cultural heritage of the period.",

The pagoda, adorned with carvings of the Eight Legions (Palbunjung), was constructed during an expansion phase of the temple. Its creation is dated to around the reign of King Munseong of Silla (approximately 855 CE), based on the discovery of the *Mugujeonggwang Great Dharani Sutra* within a reliquary chamber of one of the three pagodas at the site.\n\nThe pagoda follows the typical Silla three-story stone pagoda design, featuring a two-tiered base and three stories. The lower tier of the base is carved from a single stone, divided into a base plate and foundation stone, with three *tangju* (pillars) on each side. The number of *tangju* serves as a key indicator for dating, suggesting the pagoda’s construction aligns with the early Unified Silla period (late 7th century). The lower base’s composition of ten stone blocks is considered more archaic compared to contemporaneous pagodas, such as those at Hwangboksa and Janghang-ri, which used eight blocks.\n\nThe upper base’s panels are engraved with the Eight Legions, originally accompanied by a single *tangju*. However, only fragments survive: one figure on the south panel, two on the west, and one on the north, with the remaining panels replaced by modern stones. Despite partial damage, the carvings are highly regarded for their scale and craftsmanship, rivaling those on other notable pagodas, including the brick pagoda at Beopheungsa Temple in Andong, the Four Lion Pagoda at Hwaeomsa Temple, and pagodas at Injongsa and Jinjeonsa Temples.\n\nRestored in 1976, the pagoda underwent partial reconstruction, including the replacement of its second and third stories, four panels of the upper base’s Eight Legions, and sections of the foundation stones. The original finial is missing, altering its original form. Nevertheless, the pagoda remains the largest and most ornate stone pagoda preserved on Namsan, Gyeongju.

This artifact holds significant historical value as it vividly documents the construction and restoration processes of the Nine-story Wooden Pagoda through a contemporary source, rather than later historical texts. The charter was composed by Park Geo-mul, inscribed by Yo Geuk-il, and carved by monks Chonghye and Yeondae. It allows for comparative analysis with later historical records such as the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, enhancing its scholarly importance.

This statue is presumed to have been enshrined as the principal Buddha in the temple's main hall, Yuribojon Hall, since antiquity. Its solemn facial expression, robust and sensual volume, balanced physique, and restrained yet dynamic lines reflect the stylistic lineage of Unified Silla period (8th–9th century) Buddhist sculptures, particularly those associated with the Seokguram Grotto's main Buddha. Although the exact creation date remains unconfirmed due to the lack of foundational records, radiocarbon dating of the hemp layers beneath the lacquer (conducted in two phases) yielded dates ranging from AD 770–945 (intermediate layer: 900–945, final layer: 770–870 after lacquer removal). This suggests the statue was created as early as the late 8th century or by the early 10th century, making it one of Korea's oldest surviving dry lacquer Buddhist statues alongside the 930 CE-dated Dry Lacquer Seated Monk Hee-rang from Haeinsa Temple.

According to the stele inscription 'Naeyeonsan Bogeongsa Geumdangtapgi (內延山寶鏡寺金堂塔記)' written by Sa-myong Dae-sa in 1588, Jeokgwangjeon Hall was originally built in 603 (the 25th year of King Jinpyeong's reign), later renovated in 1214 (the first year of King Gojong's reign in Goryeo) by Monk Wonjin, and rebuilt in 1677 (the 3rd year of King Sukjong's reign). However, some scholars argue that these dates conflict with the historical spread of Buddhism on the Korean Peninsula.  \n\nJeokgwangjeon is a three-bay-by-two-bay hall with a multi-bracket system (다포) and gabled roof, enshrining a statue of Vairocana Buddha. Its foundation stones (주초) and base moldings (고맥이) exhibit distinct techniques from the Unified Silla period, and remnants of heart-shaped stone pillars (심방석) suggest the use of ancient Silla-era materials during renovations. The central front bay features a uniquely carved lion-shaped lintel (신방목), which is rare in Korea and enhances its cultural value due to its intricate craftsmanship.  \n\nThe hall's bracket system follows the multi-bracket style, with two brackets per bay on the front and rear, and one on each side—a deviation from the typical absence of side brackets in gabled-roof structures. Notably, the number of outer brackets (출목) is consistent on both interior and exterior, reflecting late 17th-century architectural features. The exposed wooden framework (연등천장) instead of a ceiling panel (우물반자) is another distinctive trait.  \n\nGiven its unique structural and decorative elements, as well as its representation of mid-Joseon architectural techniques, Jeokgwangjeon Hall is deemed worthy of designation as a National Treasure for preservation.\"\n}",

According to the Yeojidoseo (18th-century geographical records), the temple was located 5 ri south of the local government office and served as a guardian temple for the tomb of Sim Hong-bu, confirming its role as a memorial temple for the Cheongsong Sim clan. While earlier records are unavailable, it is certain that Bogwangsa was established as a protective temple in the 15th century, with Geungnakjeon Hall, Manseru Pavilion, and Chumujei Hall forming its core complex.  \n\nGeungnakjeon Hall is dated to 1615 (Wanli 43rd year) based on an inscription discovered during recent repairs. Its foundation utilizes a sloped site, with the front side elevated higher than the left side. The structure features a gabled roof, a 2-high-column 5-bay framework, and a multi-bracket system (dapo) with identical internal and external brackets (2 protruding brackets per bay, 5 sets total). This mid-Joseon bracket style contrasts with later periods, where internal brackets expanded and reduced the wall space below the inner lintel.  \n\nThe hall’s exterior brackets differ between front and rear: the front uses ox-head brackets (seoseo), while the rear employs unadorned pyramidal brackets (gyoduhyeong), with triangular (sambunduhyeong) upper ends reflecting pre-late-Joseon craftsmanship. The interior brackets, uniformly pyramidal, align with mid-Joseon techniques. The roof has double eaves at the front and single eaves at the rear. Notably, the gable sides use rare wooden lotus-patterned brackets (chongjomunhyeoneo) instead of iron cramps, a distinctive mid-Joseon feature. The wide eave purlins (bunyoe) and horizontal beams (tongpyeonggode) further exemplify mid-Joseon architectural traits.  \n\nGeungnakjeon shares structural and bracket-system similarities with 17th-century Buddhist halls designated as treasures, such as Daebi Temple’s Daeungjeon (17th century), Daejeonsa’s Bogwangjeon (1672), Hwanseongsa’s Daeungjeon (1635), and Daejeoksa’s Geungnakjeon (1635), affirming its eligibility for treasure designation.\"\n}",

It was discovered during the Japanese colonial period in Sajeong-ri (present-day Sajeong-dong), Gyeongju. In 1934, a Japanese antiquarian named Tanaka Toshinobu (田中敏信) purchased it from an antique shop, and its existence was later documented in archaeological studies. Though taken to Japan, it was repatriated to Korea in October 1972. Unlike typical tiles mass-produced using molds (瓦范, wa-beom), this tile was first shaped with a mold and then meticulously hand-sculpted to refine facial details, finished with tools. The natural and precise craftsmanship suggests it was made by a skilled artisan, with evidence of actual use. Although part of the lower-right section is missing, the harmonious depiction of the forehead, eyes, prominent nose, subtle smile, and cheekbones reflects the artistic pinnacle of Silla craftsmanship, embodying the aspirations and ideal vision of the Silla people. As the only known hand-modeled face-patterned roof tile from Silla, it stands as a masterpiece that encapsulates the simplicity, humanity, and advanced tile-making techniques of the era.",

Among these, only the Samjangbosaldo has survived to the present day. The production involved painters Wolryun (月輪), Chihum (致欽), and Upyeong (雨平), who were active in the Gyeongbuk region, particularly around Jikjisa Temple. This work provides insight into the artistic networks and stylistic traditions of the period.\n\nMeasuring 238 cm in height and 279 cm in width, the large-scale painting depicts a gathering of three bodhisattvas: Cheonjangbosal (天藏菩薩, Heavenly Treasure Bodhisattva), Jijibosal (持地菩薩, Holder of the Earth Bodhisattva), and Jijangbosal (地藏菩薩, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva). Centered around Cheonjangbosal, the three bodhisattvas are seated in a cross-legged posture on a raised Sumidan (須彌壇, Mount Sumeru altar), with their respective attendants arranged in an orderly and cohesive composition. This Samjangbosaldo holds significant art-historical value as it introduced a new iconography for 18th-century Three Holy Beings paintings, based on the 1661 text Cheonjimyeongyang Suryukjaeui Beom-eumsanbochip (天地冥陽水陸齋儀梵音刪補集).\n\nCompared to earlier works from before the 16th century, which are mostly preserved overseas, and other 17th–early 18th-century examples like the 1699 Samjangbosaldo of Seoktapsa Temple in Andong or the 1707 Samjangbosaldo of Pagyesa Temple in Daegu (both of unclear current whereabouts due to theft), this painting occupies a pivotal position as a surviving exemplar from the first half of the 18th century. Its elegant and refined brushwork, stable composition, and harmonious color palette centered on red and green reflect the stylistic characteristics of early 18th-century Buddhist paintings. Alongside the 1741 Samjangbosaldo of Namjangsa Temple in Sangju, it serves as a benchmark for studying Three Holy Beings paintings from early 18th-century Gyeongsangbuk-do Province.",

Though damaged during a rain-prayer ritual shortly after its creation, the painting has survived without fulfilling its original ceremonial function. Despite the damage, key figures remain well-preserved, and its academic value lies in retaining its original pigments and mounting, unlike other Gwabuldo paintings from the 17th–18th centuries that underwent multiple restorations. The composition centers on an imposing Shakyamuni Buddha, flanked by attendants and Four Guardian Kings, creating a dynamic spatial hierarchy. The artist’s skill is evident in the forward projection of Shakyamuni, evoking a dramatic sense of the Buddha stepping into the assembly. The inclusion of Dragon King and Dragon Princess as attendants reflects the Lotus Sutra’s teaching of universal enlightenment, while varied skin tones and bold color contrasts in figures like the Four Guardian Kings highlight the artist’s creativity. The accompanying relics—a sacred pouch (bokjangnang), a bronze mirror (donggeung), and a storage box—date to 1788, when they were reused for a newly made Gwabuldo after the original’s damage.

However, the discovery of a gilt-bronze Buddha statue from the late Unified Silla period in 1960 suggests the temple's origins may date to the late Silla era, with certainty that it was established by at least the mid-Goryeo period. The pavilion itself was rebuilt between 1644 and 1683, during the mid-to-late 17th century, after being destroyed by fires during the Imjin and Jeongyu Wars (1592–1598).\n\nThe pavilion is a two-story structure with three bays on each side. Its 3x3 bay layout reflects early 17th-century architectural trends, as later pavilions expanded to five or seven bays. The lower-story columns feature naturally curved doranjyu (柱) and cylindrical columns with gradual tapering, while the upper-story columns are uniformly cylindrical. The use of doranjyu aligns with post-Imjin War timber shortages and Joseon-era naturalist aesthetics. Notably, the pavilion employs a rare dual-beam system: an upper beam functions as the primary load-bearing member, while a lower beam acts as a support, a design uncommon in other pavilions or Buddhist halls.\n\nThe pavilion exhibits a hybrid architectural style, combining dapo (多包), jusimpo (柱心包), and ikgong (翼工) bracket systems. Floral brackets (화반) in the central bays of the front and sides support the upper structure, with the front and rear facades more elaborately decorated than the sides. The chamchae (첨차) brackets, salmi (살미) purlins, and decorative elements of the window frames reflect mid-to-late Joseon craftsmanship. While the central bays omit intercolumniation brackets in favor of floral brackets—a transitional feature—the pavilion distinguishes itself from typical hybrid dapo-style structures. Historical records confirm its reconstruction timeline, and its well-preserved state offers critical insights into 17th-century architectural evolution and the revival of Buddhist temple construction in the Uiseong region.",

The creation period and supervising monk are confirmed through the biography of Hwanjeokdang Uicheon (1630–1690) recorded in the *Punggyeojip* (Collection of Punggye Myeongchal, 1640–1708). Hwanjeokdang Uicheon, a disciple of Myeongchal, was born in Seonsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, ordained at age 11, and entered nirvana at Haeinsa Temple’s Baengnyeonam Hermitage in 1690 at age 88. According to his biography, he supervised the carving of this Maitreya Buddha, erected a stele, and built Hwanjeokam Hermitage during his stay at Bongamsa Temple from 1662 to 1663. The statue measures approximately 539.6 cm in height and 502.6 cm in width. The halo around the head is deeply carved at the top and gradually becomes shallower downward. The Buddha has a rounded, oval face with a prominent nose, soft eyes, and a composed closed mouth. The three neck lines (tridhara) are subtly rendered, and the monastic robe (saṃghāti) covers both shoulders with simple drapery. A horizontal chest sash with a knot is depicted, and the folds are carved with restrained yet dynamic rhythm. The seated posture is Giljangzu (auspicious pose), with the exposed right foot appearing small relative to the Buddha’s size and broad knees. Notably, the facial features, posture, and drapery style reflect elements seen in 17th-century Buddhist paintings, such as the *Sejong Gwaebul of Jukrimsa Temple, Naju* (1622), *Yeongsanhoei Gwaebul of Hwaeomsa Temple, Gurye* (1653), *Yeongsanhoei Painting of Ssanggyesa Temple, Hadong* (1688), and *Yeongsanhoei Painting of Heungkuksa Temple, Yeosu* (1693), highlighting its correlation with contemporary Buddhist art. The hand gesture (mudra) is Yonghwasuin, symbolizing Maitreya, with both hands holding a long floral branch. As a rock-carved Buddha with a definitively dated creation year (1663), it holds significant academic value as a benchmark for studying post-Joseon rock-carved Buddhas and Maitreya iconography. The statue’s historical and scholarly importance lies in its well-documented creation context, including its patrons, purpose, and iconography, which are rare for rock-carved Buddhas. Additionally, its realistic carving techniques, distinct facial features, and creative expressions linked to Buddhist paintings underscore its high artistic value, warranting its designation as a Treasure for preservation.",

      "content_en": "1. Historical Background of Gyeongju Bunhwangsa and the Flagpole Supports\nGyeongju Bunhwangsa, located in Guhwang-dong, Gyeongju, is recorded in the Samguk Yusa as one of the Seven Great Temples, established in 634 CE (3rd year of Queen Seondeok's reign) north of Yonggung Palace. Alongside Hwangnyongsa, Bunhwangsa was built under royal patronage and maintained close ties with Queen Seondeok and subsequent monarchs. In 643 CE, Queen Seondeok hosted the returning monk Jajang (590–658) at Bunhwangsa, and in 645 CE, construction of the Hwangnyongsa Pagoda began at his request. As a central Buddhist sanctuary, Bunhwangsa played a pivotal role in Silla's religious and political landscape.\n\nToday, remnants such as the mock-brick stone pagoda, stone Buddhas, the flagpole supports, an octagonal well, a monument base, and architectural stone fragments attest to its historical significance. The flagpole supports, situated south of the temple entrance, are strongly associated with Bunhwangsa due to their alignment with the temple's original layout, their comparison to Hwangnyongsa's damaged supports, and the temple's reduced scale over time. These supports are conclusively linked to Bunhwangsa.\n\n2. Style and Features of the Flagpole Supports\nPhotographs from the Japanese colonial period indicate minimal changes to the supports. While the original flagpole is missing, the two identical supports and a tortoise-shaped base stone (gwandaeseok) remain intact. The supports are deeply embedded, suggesting they were anchored without a separate platform. The tortoise-shaped base, though less ornate than typical Silla stonework, features a carved head and feet, with a square platform adorned with lotus motifs and a drainage groove. This base is unique among Silla-era flagpole supports.\n\nThe supports, square in cross-section and tapering upward, have a raised outer face (148 cm high) with chamfered corners. Their tops curve gently outward, and three circular holes (15 cm diameter) at upper, middle, and lower levels once secured the flagpole. These techniques align with Unified Silla-era practices. The smooth, meticulously finished surfaces reflect advanced masonry skills. Comparisons with supports at Mangdeoksaji, Bomunsaji, and Namgansaji suggest contemporaneous construction.\n\n3. Historical and Cultural Value\nThe Bunhwangsa Flagpole Supports exemplify Unified Silla's refined stoneworking techniques and aesthetic principles. Their tortoise-shaped base, a singular feature among surviving supports, adds symbolic depth. The precise alignment of the base's carvings with the temple's axis highlights its functional and ritual importance. The supports' structural design—raised bases, chamfered edges, and triple flagpole holes—demonstrates technical sophistication. Given their historical context, artistic merit, and rarity, these supports warrant recognition as a National Designated Heritage site, contributing significantly to the study of Silla Buddhist architecture and material culture.",

      "content_en": "The Daeungjeon Hall of Songnimsa Temple is a single-story structure with a front of five bays and sides of three bays. The five-bay front is a rare example among late Joseon-period Buddhist halls. Historical records indicate that pre-Imjin War (1592–1598) main Buddhist halls typically featured multi-story designs or three or more bays, but post-war reconstructions in the 17th century often failed to restore original scales. The trend of shrinking temple architecture intensified after the war, leading to the standardization of three-bay front and side halls. In this context, Songnimsa's five-bay Daeungjeon stands out for its scale, distinguishing it from other temples where three-bay halls became the norm. Few five-bay halls from the late Joseon period survive today, most of which are designated as national heritage, underscoring its significance.\n\nRebuilt in 1649, the hall retains archaic features in its layout, including the placement of the altar (budan) and rear wall (hubulbyeok), as well as bay divisions. The altar, centrally located and measuring 13m (width) × 2.44m (depth) × 1.03m (height), occupies the central three bays, leaving limited space for rituals despite the five-bay facade. This contrasts with contemporary halls that expanded ritual spaces by repositioning interior columns. Songnimsa's design, with its rear wall aligned to three bays, reflects older techniques seen in buildings like Manboksa Temple's Seogeumdang and Muryangsa Temple's Geuknakjeon.\n\nThe hall's bracket system (gongpo) is classified as gyodugyeong-style, lacking sojeong (decorative brackets), a form more common in earlier periods. This style is concentrated in the Palgongsan region, linked to monk architects like Gakwon (覺元) and his successors, suggesting regional craftsmanship traditions. Structural analyses of related buildings warrant further study.\n\nThe 1850 renovation reused old materials, as documented in sangnangmun (upper beam inscriptions). This repair, likely necessitated by resource shortages, may have altered the roof from a hip-and-gable (paljak) to a gabled (matbae) style. While such adaptive reuse was common in late Joseon halls, Songnimsa's documented evidence of material reuse and structural changes provides unique insights compared to other halls where only physical traces exist.",
