It consists of a body for burning incense and a lid sculpted in the form of a kneeling kirin, a mythical creature. The body flares outward at the top and is supported by three animal-shaped legs. Cloud patterns adorn the body and its rim, with the lid placed atop. The center of the lid features a kirin turning its head backward, its seat engraved with lightning patterns. The kirin's horn is broken, its mane rendered in curly details, and its eyes accented with black pigment dots. Structurally, incense smoke is designed to escape through the open mouth of the kirin. The burner is enveloped in a subtle, jade-green glaze characteristic of the period, exuding elegance. During the 12th century, when celadon glazes reached their zenith, such symbolic animal- and plant-shaped celadons were widely produced.",

Measuring 42.1 cm in height with a mouth diameter of 6.2 cm and base diameter of 17 cm, the vase features a small, low, slightly flared rim and broad, imposing shoulders. A floral band encircles the area below the rim, while a lotus pattern adorns the base. The central body displays intricate inlaid cloud and crane motifs: within black-and-white inlaid circular compartments, cranes ascend amid clouds, while outside these circles, cranes descend toward the lower section. This dynamic arrangement—alternating upward and downward crane movements—creates an illusion of spatial freedom beyond the vessel's physical constraints, reflecting Goryeo artisans' innovative approach to composition. The technical mastery and creative expression evident in the design underscore the sophistication and artistic ingenuity of Goryeo celadon craftsmanship.",

It comprises a body for burning incense and a lid shaped like a crouching lion. The body is supported by three animal-shaped legs adorned with finely carved cloud patterns on its surface, with additional cloud motifs arranged at three points along the upper rim. The lid depicts a lion seated on a pedestal decorated with floral patterns. The lion's posture, slightly shifted to the left, creates a dynamic visual effect. It is shown with its mouth open, one knee bent, and eyes rendered with black dots to represent pupils. Swirling patterns mimic the lion's mane at the back of its neck and hips, while its tail is raised and pressed against its back. The glaze exhibits a pale greenish-blue hue with a subtle, lustrous sheen. Structurally, the incense smoke from the body is designed to escape through the lion's open mouth, showcasing the refined craftsmanship of celadon incense burners from this period. During the early 12th century, when jade-green celadon reached its zenith, many symbolic celadon works modeled after auspicious animals and plants were produced. Notably, lion-shaped incense burners were particularly acclaimed by Song dynasty scholars for their exceptional artistry.",

Originally located on Bongdae Peak in Bukhansan, it was relocated to Gyeongbokgung Palace for preservation and is now housed in the National Museum of Korea. The stele is made of a rectangularly carved stone, erected on a two-tiered platform atop a natural rock base. The upper portion is partially missing, with the remaining body measuring 1.54 meters in height and 69 cm in width. The inscription consists of 12 lines, each containing 32 characters in regular script (haeseo), detailing the king's purpose for visiting the region and the reasons for erecting the stele. The text predominantly praises King Jinheung's territorial expansions. Although the exact date of construction remains uncertain due to eroded inscriptions, it is estimated to have been erected between 561 (the year of the Changnyeong Stele) and 568 (the year of the Hwangchoryeong Stele) during King Jinheung's reign. The stele was discovered and deciphered by scholar Kim Jeong-hui (Jeong-hee) in 1816, during the Joseon Dynasty, and remains a critical historical resource for studying the Three Kingdoms period.",

The body features raised scales and large pectoral fins carved in relief at the center. The handle, modeled after a lotus stem, curves naturally over the body, while the lid replicates a fish's tail fin. The jade-green glaze harmonizes with intricate incised patterns on the fins and floral motifs, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship.

Originally used in Buddhist rituals to symbolically cleanse evil, the water bottle was a vessel introduced to Korea via China from Western styles, but reached its most refined form during the Goryeo period. This masterpiece stands out among such artifacts with its serene jade-green glaze of a pale greenish-blue hue, adorned solely with white slip inlay depicting willows, reeds, lotus blossoms, and a pair of mandarin ducks arranged in a pictorial composition. The neck features a peony flower inlaid on each side. The spout, designed in an octagonal shape, is elegantly crafted and stands vertically atop the neck. The pouring mouth, round and modestly attached to one side of the shoulder, originally had a lid that is now lost. Early inlaid celadon pieces from this period are characterized by their meticulously refined glaze and clay body, with the jade-green glaze enhancing their sophistication. The addition of inlaid patterns further elevated their decorative appeal. This water bottle exemplifies the highly refined and elegant style of early Goryeo inlaid celadon craftsmanship.",

Published in 1448 (30th year of Sejong's reign), it comprises six volumes and six books in metal type. Contrasted with the Chinese rhyme book Hongmu Zhengyun, 'Dongguk Jeongun' means 'Correct Sounds of the Eastern Kingdom,' reflecting its purpose to unify and standardize chaotic Hanja pronunciations in Korea. Completed in September 1447, it was distributed to institutions like Sungkyunkwan by November 1448. Only Volumes 1 and 6 survive today. The main text uses woodblock characters, while smaller text and preface employ Gabinja type; the large characters are based on the handwriting of Grand Prince Jinyang. This work holds immense significance as Korea's first systematic documentation of Hanja pronunciation in its own phonetic system, rivaling Hunminjeongeum in linguistic value.

It serves as a crucial resource for studying both the stylistic characteristics of the enshrined Buddha and the architectural trends of the period. This particular shrine, standing 18cm tall, is crafted from bronze with a gilded surface. Inside, a square base surrounded by a railing supports the main Buddha triad—comprising the principal Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas—covered by a roofed structure resembling a Buddhist hall. The hall-shaped lid features large windows on the front and sides, allowing clear visibility of the enshrined statues. The principal Buddha has an abstract facial expression, with robes draped over both shoulders rendered in simplified linear folds. The mandorla (light halo) behind the Buddha is divided into a head halo and a body halo, adorned with flame patterns along the edges. The bodhisattvas on either side, except for their beaded crowns, share similar stylistic and technical features with the principal Buddha. The shrine remains in excellent condition, with its golden luster still vibrant and traces of green patina on the roof. Based on stylistic elements such as the elongated torso of the principal Buddha, irregular robe folds, and the beaded crowns of the bodhisattvas, it is estimated to have been created in the 11th–12th century under the influence of Northern Chinese traditions. This artifact holds significant value as a rare example illustrating wooden architectural styles and sculptural techniques from the Goryeo period or earlier.",

      "content_en": "This statue depicts a bodhisattva seated on a throne with the right leg crossed over the left, the right elbow resting on the knee, and the fingers of the right hand touching the cheek. Standing 80 cm tall, it was acquired by a Japanese individual in 1912 and donated to the Japanese Government-General of Korea. It was transferred to the Government-General Museum in 1916 and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The bodhisattva wears an elaborate crown with two strands of ornamentation cascading down to the shoulders. The square-shaped face, with prominent cheekbones and a recessed mouth, exudes a plump, serene smile. The upper body is robust and erect, while the lower body exhibits graceful curves. The hands and feet are disproportionately large compared to the slender limbs and physique. The overall form is elastic, smooth, and rhythmic, enhancing the statue's elegant aura. The celestial garment drapes over the shoulders, flares upward like bird feathers, flows down the chest, crosses at the left leg, wraps around the knees and arms. The skirt, slightly thick, features skillfully carved U-shaped folds. The elliptical lotus pedestal beneath the left foot is engraved with lotus patterns, though the halo at the back of the head is missing. Radiographic analysis in 1963 revealed no internal defects or repairs, with the material and craftsmanship noted as highly unusual. The balanced posture, beautiful drapery, and enigmatic meditative expression suggest it is a masterpiece of Korean Buddhist art, likely created in the mid-6th century or shortly thereafter.",

The robe drapes both shoulders, featuring a V-shaped fold at the front and feather-like trailing edges on either side. The right hand is raised with palm facing forward and fingers pointing upward, while the left hand, also palm-forward, has two fingers bent downward—a distinctive gesture.

Around the principal Buddha, the halo is divided into a circular head halo and rectangular body halo, intricately carved with lotus, vine, and grapevine motifs. The pedestal, a flared cylindrical base, is engraved with lotus designs. Stylistically similar to the National Treasure Gilt-bronze Sinmyo Buddha Triad, this statue follows the iconography of the Northern and Southern Dynasties of China.

Despite the dynasty's policy of promoting Confucianism and suppressing Buddhism, it remained a protected important temple until 1504, when King Yeonsan converted it into a brothel named Yeonbangwon (聯芳院), expelling the monks and leading to the temple's demise. This pagoda is the only one of its kind from the Joseon period, standing approximately 12 meters tall.

The pagoda's body comprises ten stories: the first three tiers retain the 'Asia' shape, while the upper seven form a square plan. Each story meticulously replicates wooden architectural elements, including roofs, bracketing systems (hyungja), and pillars. Unlike most Korean stone pagodas made of granite, this marble structure closely resembles the 10-story stone pagoda of Gyeongcheonsa Temple from the Goryeo period, drawing significant attention.

Both figures are mounted on short-legged horses atop thick rectangular bases. The horse's hindquarters feature a lamp with a hole, and a protruding spout on the chest allows water to be poured through the hollow body. The master figure wears a triangular hat adorned with a band and decorations, along with lattice-patterned trousers, reflecting elaborate horse trappings. The servant figure has a topknot wrapped in a headband, a bare upper body, a burden on its back, and holds a bell-like object in the right hand, suggesting a role as a guide. These ceramics provide critical insights into Silla-era spiritual beliefs, clothing, weaponry, horse gear, and artistic design.",

      "content_en": "This Buddhist statue, discovered in 1930 in Bongsan-ri, Hwacheon-myeon, Goksan-gun, Hwanghae-do, is currently housed at the Leeum Museum of Art. Standing 15.5 cm tall, it is a triad (three-bodied Buddha) carved on a single large halo (광배), with the central Buddha flanked by smaller bodhisattvas on either side. It is the largest extant statue of this format. The flanking bodhisattvas are significantly smaller, appearing almost dangling at the edges of the halo, which accentuates the prominence of the central Buddha. Apart from minor scratches on the Buddha's chest and the halo's right edge, the overall preservation is excellent.\n\nThe central Buddha has a plump face with a subtle smile, a large usnisa (육계, topknot), and thick robes covering the shoulders and extending to the ankles. The right hand is raised with the palm facing outward, while the left hand is lowered, palm downward. The halo, detachable from the statue, is fixed via a protruding spike on the back of the Buddha. Shaped like a boat (배 모양), the halo features a head halo and body halo around the Buddha, adorned with lotus, vine, and morning glory patterns. Flame motifs frame the edges, with small Buddha figures between the sections. The two attendant bodhisattvas at the halo's base have large faces and slender, cylindrical bodies, with X-shaped robe patterns on their chests. Their craftsmanship appears less refined compared to the central Buddha.\n\nAn inscription on the halo's reverse records that five individuals commissioned the statue to honor their teacher and parents. Stylistic and epigraphic analysis suggests it is a Goguryeo work, with the inscribed year 'Sinmyo' (辛卯) corresponding to 571 CE (13th year of King Pyeongwon's reign). While the statue's overall form—characterized by a large face, abstract body, and hand gestures—follows the style of the National Treasure Gilt-Bronze Standing Buddha from Yeonga 7th Year, it exhibits a softer, more refined aesthetic compared to the earlier piece's robust vigor.",

      "content_en": "This 20.7 cm tall gilt-bronze statue of a standing bodhisattva was discovered in 1967 in Samyang-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul, and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The statue exhibits a crack above the ankle and a partially detached left robe. The bodhisattva wears a triangular crown adorned with a small Buddha image and has a rounded, serene face with a faint smile. The narrow shoulders and protruding abdomen create a curved silhouette reminiscent of a bow when viewed from the side. Thick robes draped in a U-shape around the waist and knees obscure the leg contours, with simplified linear folds. The right hand holds a flask (vase), while the left hand extends upward with the thumb and index finger forming a straight V-shape—a distinctive gesture. The lotus pedestal features inverted petals with sharp tips, contrasting the statue's softness. Identified as Avalokiteshvara due to the triangular crown with a Buddha image and the flask, the statue's plump facial features, body proportions, and U-shaped drapery suggest a creation date in the early 7th century. It serves as a critical artifact illustrating the prevalence of Avalokiteshvara veneration during the late Three Kingdoms period.",

The square-like face lacks a smile, imparting a solemn expression. The thin robe clings closely to the body, subtly revealing bodily contours, though the garment's folds are not sharply defined. Bead decorations descending from the shoulders cross in an X-shape near the abdomen and extend down the legs, with a round floral medallion at the center—a motif influenced by ancient Chinese styles also seen in Three Kingdoms period gilt-bronze Buddhist statues. The right hand holds the robe's hem, while the left clasps a large water pot (jingbi), identifying the figure as Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. The hexagonal pedestal features an inverted lotus pattern at the base and an open lotus motif above, with broad, softly carved petals distinctive of Baekje craftsmanship. Despite extensive oxidation, the statue retains a vibrant golden hue and embodies the graceful elegance characteristic of Baekje Buddhist sculptures.",

Currently, the pedestal (daeza) on which the Bodhisattva once stood and the crown (gwan) it wore are missing, and the left hand has broken off at the forearm. The head appears slightly large in proportion to the body, with a prominent usnisa (topknot) atop the head. The face gives an impression of stiffness, as the area below the eyes is notably elongated compared to the upper part. The celestial garment (cheoni) diagonally crosses the broad chest, flows down the back, and drapes over both arms, with the right hand holding one of its strands. The skirt, folded once at the waist, cascades over the knees and extends to the ankles. The U-shaped, raised wrinkles on the skirt are rendered with sophisticated and elegant craftsmanship. While similar Bodhisattva statues from the Unified Silla period are commonly found, this piece shares typological affinities with works such as the Gyeongju Gamsansa Stone Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), created in 719 (18th year of King Seongdeok's reign), and the Gyeongju Gulbulsa Temple Stone Quadruple Buddha (Treasure), dated to the mid-8th century, despite differences in material.

The head halo contains lotus motifs, while intricate flame patterns adorn the outer edges of both sections. The pedestal beneath the figures bears double-lined lotus designs, a style reminiscent of Baekje-period works such as the Jeongjiwon-inscribed Gilt-bronze Standing Shakyamuni Buddha (Treasure) from Busosan Mountain and the Gilt-bronze Seated Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), though executed with greater refinement. The 'X'-shaped drapery, wing-like robe folds, and bent finger gesture reflect typical Three Kingdoms period iconography.

The main body (tapsin) alternates between door motifs and vividly sculpted Four Heavenly Kings, while the roof stone meticulously replicates wooden architecture with tile grooves, eave ends, and rafter patterns. Though the original finial is lost, a gold-plated bronze inscription (geumdong tapji) discovered during relocation confirmed its construction date to 844.  \n\nAs the oldest extant relic stupa in Korea, this masterpiece exemplifies refined elegance and craftsmanship, setting a precedent for subsequent stupa designs. Its historical and artistic significance lies in preserving the transition from abstract to representational Buddhist sculpture and its role in establishing Seon Buddhism's legacy.\"\n}",

Originating from King Jeongjo's personal diary, the Johnheongak Ilgi, which he began as a crown prince to reflect on his actions and studies—inspired by the Confucian Analects' teaching of daily self-examination—the records evolved into an official state diary.

      "content_en": "This is a Buncheong flat-sided bottle from the early Joseon period, measuring 22.5 cm in height, 5.2 cm in mouth diameter, and 8.6 cm in base diameter. The body is rounded with flattened sides and a small mouth. It features a grayish-brown clay body coated with white slip and a thick transparent light brown glaze. The shoulder below the mouth is adorned with a band of stylized lotus motifs, while the front flattened surface is decorated with lotus leaves, blossoms, and fish patterns. The sides display lotus motifs on the upper and middle sections, and a double lotus band at the lower part. The piece primarily employs the pajiki technique (scraping away slip to reveal the clay beneath), with additional harmonious line work for detailing. The striking contrast between the white slip and grayish-brown clay highlights the craftsmanship. Notably, the naturalistic depiction of lotus leaves and fish amidst multiple lotus buds on the front exemplifies the characteristic use of the pajiki technique, making it a representative work of this method.",

This work, *Sehando* (Winter Journey), measures 69.2 cm in width and 23 cm in height, and is considered his masterpiece. Painted in 1844 during his exile on Jeju Island, the artwork includes a personal inscription by Kim.

Above the right side, the title *Sehando* is accompanied by the phrases 'U-si-seong' (A Scholar’s Winter Thoughts) and 'Wandang' (Kim’s pen name), along with his seal.

Its unique form, unseen in traditional Korean pagodas, traces its origins to the Chinese Wu-Yue Kingdom. The last ruler of Wu-Yue, King Chongui (Chun Hongxu), was inspired by the legend of Indian Emperor Ashoka, who divided the Buddha's sacred relics into 84,000 stupas. Following this tradition, Chun Hongxu crafted 84,000 miniature pagodas from gold, bronze, and iron, each containing a copy of the 'Bohyeobin Dharani Sutra.' The only surviving stone version of such a pagoda in Korea is preserved at Dongguk University Museum. Originally found collapsed in a valley near Daepyeong-ri, Buk-myeon, Cheonan, the pagoda was relocated to its current site. The temple site, dated to the Goryeo period based on remaining stone foundations, pillar bases, and roof tiles, lacks historical records. The restored pagoda, incomplete with only five remaining stones, deviates from conventional Korean tower designs. It features two stacked square box-shaped stones topped with a decorative finial, a hexagonal base carved with Buddha images, a square platform, and another hexagonal tier engraved with four scenes from the Buddha's past lives. A circular sarira hole at the center of the top tier once held the sutra. The uppermost stone, resembling donkey ears, depicts episodes from the Buddha's life. Influenced by Chinese Bohyeobin pagodas, this Goryeo-era structure is a rare and invaluable artifact. In 2018, structural reinforcements were implemented using titanium plates to replace coin spacers, and a new base stone was added to enhance stability, based on humanities research and 3D scanning.",

Typically, Amitabha Triad paintings feature Avalokiteshvara and Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva as attendants, but this work uniquely substitutes Mahasthamaprapta with Ksitigarbha. Amitabha Buddha gazes downward at a person reborn in the Pure Land, radiating light. Ksitigarbha, positioned to the right, holds a bead in his right hand. Avalokiteshvara, standing before Amitabha with a slightly bent waist, holds a lotus pedestal on his palm.

Dated to the late Goryeo period, this work exhibits distinctive features, including the substitution of Ksitigarbha for Mahasthamaprapta, the placement of Avalokiteshvara in front of Amitabha, and the emphasis on illuminating the reborn soul.

It measures 29.2 cm in height, with a mouth diameter of 10.7 cm and a base diameter of 14 cm. The mouth flares outward, the shoulder swells before gradually narrowing downward, and the lid features a prominent lotus bud-shaped knob. The decoration includes faint underglaze blue patterns: a band of small, dense lotus motifs encircles the knob and its surroundings, with seven large dots placed around it. Horizontal lines with dots between them are drawn on the lid's sides. Simplified lotus bands adorn the shoulder and lower body of the jar. The central design depicts a plum tree trunk and bamboo branches rendered with nuanced shading. A distinctive feature is the bold simplification of patterns, emphasizing negative space to highlight the main motifs. Based on its form and decoration, it is presumed to have been produced at a state-managed kiln (gwanyo).",

Most known gilt-bronze towers measure 20–30 cm in height, with those exceeding 50 cm being exceptionally rare. However, this tower stands at 155 cm in its current state, indicating a notably large scale. Although only five stories of the tower body remain, it is believed to have originally comprised seven stories, with the loss of part of its finial suggesting it was even taller in antiquity.\n\nThe tower follows the general form of stone pagodas, featuring a two-tiered base, a five-story tower body, and a finial at the apex. The base is adorned with pillar motifs reminiscent of wooden architecture on its corners and surfaces. The lower tier’s surfaces bear lotus petals encircled by rounded bands, a characteristic feature of Goryeo-period stone pagoda styles.\n\nA railing encircles the base, supporting the tower body. The first story includes an entrance, pillars, and a roof, faithfully replicating wooden architectural techniques. While the second to fifth stories are carved with Buddhist images, the craftsmanship is relatively unrefined. Wind bells (풍탁) once hung from each roof corner, though many have been lost, leaving only a few remaining.\n\nDespite the near-complete loss of its original gold plating, the tower is exceptionally well-preserved. Its expansive base contrasts with the tower body’s light, soaring appearance. The profuse decorative elements and numerous ornaments underscore its nature as a craft pagoda, while its adherence to wooden architectural forms is evident throughout. Given its large scale, meticulous detailing, and metallurgical techniques, it is speculated to have been crafted in the early Goryeo period.",

Another identical painting exists, distinguished by its colored pigments and black-inked labels identifying buildings. Based on the presence and reconstruction dates of depicted structures, it is estimated to have been created by Dohwaseo (Royal Painting Academy) artists before 1830 (30th year of King Sunjo's reign). These paintings hold greater historical value for architectural research than artistic merit, offering a visually superior representation of palace layouts and landscapes compared to flat maps or the Donggwoldo diagrams.

The Mahayana Abhidharma-Samuchchaya is a text that compiles and elucidates the wisdom necessary for attaining Buddhahood. This volume, translated by Xuanzang during the Tang Dynasty, is part of the First Tripitaka Koreana created during the reign of King Hyeonjong of Goryeo (r. 1011–1031). Comprising 27 leaves, it was printed on thick, durable paper from woodblocks and designed to be unfolded like a folding screen. When folded, it measures 31 cm in height and 12.2 cm in width. In the Tripitaka catalog, which organizes texts according to the Cheonjagam (Thousand Character Classic) sequence, this volume is stored in the 'Bo' (寶) case. Leaf numbering uses the character 'jang' (丈) for leaves 1 to 26, with the final leaf marked as 'jang' (張), reflecting the common practice in the First Tripitaka. A distinctive feature is the omission of the final stroke in the 'gyeong' (竟) character at the end of the text, a hallmark of early Goryeo Tripitaka editions. The paper quality, carving technique, and ink tone confirm its 11th-century origin, and it remains in relatively good condition.",

A leading Neo-Confucianist and successor to the academic lineage of Yulgok Yi I, Song dedicated his life to studying Zhu Xi’s philosophy and was central to the Giho School. Renowned for his logical prose and calligraphy, his intellectual legacy remains influential.\n\nThe portrait, measuring 89.7 cm in height and 67.6 cm in width, is a half-length depiction on silk with polychrome pigments. Song is depicted wearing a black geon (hat) and a changui (scholar’s everyday robe), gazing to the right. His robust physique, exaggerated in scale, combined with distinctive eyebrows and deep wrinkles around the cheekbones, conveys a sense of scholarly depth. The face is lightly tinted with brown lines delineating wrinkles, while the robe’s folds are rendered with soft, simplified curves.\n\nInscriptions on the upper right include a 1651 self-commentary by Song in regular script (haeseo), and above center, a 1707 poem by King Sukjong honoring Jeong Mong-ju in clerical script (yeseo), accompanied by the notation 'Jeongmyo Year' (1707). However, uncertainties about the timing of these inscriptions complicate dating the artwork. While stylistic elements like simplified drapery and lack of shading suggest a 17th-century origin, some scholars argue it is an 18th-century copy, given the later inscription.\n\nAfter Song’s death, numerous shrines and academies were established nationwide to venerate him, leading to the production of many copies of his portrait. This version, regarded as one of the finest, epitomizes the aesthetic and symbolic traits of Joseon scholar portraits, reflecting both individuality and Confucian ideals.",

Each bell measures 14.4 cm and 14.3 cm in diameter, with the small bells (2.4 cm in diameter) featuring four oval holes. The main body has 2–3 lines of dotted patterns and a large '十' (sun symbol) motif.

The convex middle tapers toward the ends, which have bells with four oval holes and bronze beads inside. One bell has an additional small hole in the center.\n\n3. **Combined Ssangduryeong**: An X-shaped bell (17.3 cm long, 4.4 cm bell diameter, 628 g) formed by interlocking two bodies. One end has an insertion hole, while the other has a knob to secure the connection.\n\n4. **Ganduryeong (Cannonball-Shaped Bells)**: A pair (14.7 cm and 14.9 cm tall, 616.5 g and 571 g) divided into a body and handle with a brim. Hollow compartments hold bronze beads in the upper section, while the lower section is empty to amplify sound.

      "content_en": "The Great Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, often abbreviated as the 'Great Prajñā Sūtra' or 'Prajñā Sūtra,' is a foundational Mahayana Buddhist text centered on the concept of śūnyatā (emptiness), teaching that all phenomena lack inherent existence and thus should not be clung to. In Korea, it is widely known as the 'Heart Sutra' and is universally recited across Buddhist sects. This particular set comprises Volumes 162, 170, and 463 of the First Tripitaka Koreana, carved during the Goryeo Dynasty under King Hyeonjong (r. 1011–1031) to invoke Buddhist protection against Khitan invasions. Translated into Chinese by the Tang dynasty scholar Xuanzang, these volumes were printed on mulberry paper using woodblocks and designed as scrolls. Volume 162’s colophon reveals it was commissioned in 1046 by Heo Jinsu to pray for the king’s peace, his mother’s longevity, and his deceased father’s spiritual welfare. Distinct from the later Haeinsa Tripitaka Koreana (Second Tripitaka), the First Edition exhibits differences such as varying character counts (25 lines × 14 characters per line vs. 23 × 14), absence of publication dates, use of pi-hui (avoidance of imperial names) and abbreviated characters, and the use of '장(丈)' or '폭(幅)' instead of '장(張)' for page numbering. These three volumes, preserved in similar condition, are critical for dating other First Tripitaka prints due to Volume 162’s explicit historical record.",

      "content_en": "This set of four white porcelain bowls was created in the early Joseon period. Each bowl measures approximately 11.1 cm in height, 21.1 cm in rim diameter, and 7.9 cm in base diameter. The rims exhibit a bold, outward-flaring form. The pieces are devoid of decorative patterns, with a well-melted glaze that imparts a bright white hue. Inside the base of each bowl, the glaze was scratched to inscribe the characters 'Cheon' (天), 'Ji' (地), 'Hyeon' (玄), and 'Hwang' (黃). These inscriptions are believed to correspond to the names of royal storage houses—Cheonjago, Jijago, Hyeonjago, and Hwangjago—located near Geunjeongjeon Hall in Gyeongbokgung Palace, where royal tableware was stored and categorized. The refined clay, evenly applied glaze, pure white color, neat footring, and fine sand supports suggest these were high-quality wares produced at state-operated kilns in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, for royal use. As early Joseon white porcelain, this set serves as critical material for tracing the historical lineage of Korean white porcelain craftsmanship.",

The front and back panels depict chrysanthemums and orchids rendered in raised relief, accompanied by bees and butterflies. The orchids are in cobalt blue, chrysanthemums in copper-red, stems and leaves in iron-black, and insects in iron-black or copper-red.

Additionally, land and official positions were bestowed upon their parents, spouses, and descendants. These details, absent from the Joseon Annals, were revealed through this document. The text employs Idumun (吏讀文), a mix of Chinese characters and Korean phonetic elements, making it a valuable historical and linguistic resource. Printed using woodtype (목활자), it is one of the most complete early Joseon woodblock-printed documents surviving in South Korea. Its rolled format reflects early Joseon characteristics, though the uneven letter sizing and irregular arrangement indicate less refined printing techniques. As a rare extant example of early Korean woodtype printing, it holds significant importance in the history of Korean typography.",

It synthesizes medical knowledge from Joseon and Chinese sources with clinical experiences. Although King Seonjo initially commissioned its compilation in 1596 with Heo Jun, Yang Yesu (楊禮壽), and Lee Myeong-won (李命源), the project was halted by war. Heo Jun independently completed it after 14 years of dedication. The Dongui Bogam is widely acclaimed as the most outstanding medical work authored by Koreans, both domestically and internationally. The first edition, printed in 1613 using wooden movable type by the Royal Secretariat (Nauiwon), consists of 25 volumes and 25 books.\n\nThe text is organized into five main sections: a 2-volume table of contents, the Naegyeong Pyeon (內景篇, Internal Medicine) with 4 volumes and 26 subsections, the Oehyeong Pyeon (外形篇, External Medicine) with 4 volumes and 26 subsections, the Japbyeong Pyeon (雜病篇, Miscellaneous Diseases) with 11 volumes and 38 subsections, the Tangyeok Pyeon (湯液篇, Decoctions and Medicinals) with 3 volumes and 17 subsections, and the Chimgu Pyeon (鍼灸篇, Acupuncture and Moxibustion) with 1 volume and 1 subsection. Each section systematically categorizes diseases, detailing theories, prescriptions, and source references.\n\nThe Dongui Bogam was widely disseminated beyond Joseon, influencing medical practices in China and Japan. In China, it was published multiple times starting in 1763 (Qianlong 28), while in Japan, the first edition appeared in 1724 (Kyoto Shorin) and was reprinted in 1799 (Osaka Shorin), solidifying its status as a essential text in East Asian medicine.\n\nThe Kyujanggak Institute of Seoul National University houses two copies. The Taebaeksan Sagobon (太白山史庫本), a 24-volume set, lacks Volume 16 of the Japbyeong Pyeon. However, a separate 17-volume set from the same woodblock edition includes the missing volume, complementing the Taebaeksan copy. Designated in 2008, the Dongui Bogam’s historical significance as the first edition and its completeness—achieved through the supplementary volume—were pivotal in its recognition as a national treasure.",

The site is believed to have been a temple from the Three Kingdoms period, as evidenced by numerous roof tile and pottery fragments found in the area.\n\nThe Bodhisattva stands gracefully on a lotus-adorned pedestal, with a slightly bent right knee, exuding natural elegance. The crown, decorated with floral motifs, features a small Buddha image at its center. The rounded face, with distinct eyes, nose, and mouth, bears a serene smile.\n\nThe slender, well-proportioned body is clad in thin, clinging robes. The garment drapes over the right arm, forming a circular fold at the knee before cascading over the left arm to the pedestal. A necklace with bead decorations extends from the shoulders in an X-pattern, mirrored on the statue's back. The right hand gently holds a lotus bud, while the left hand, though missing its original object, suggests it once grasped an offering. The seven-sided pedestal is engraved with downward-facing lotus petals.\n\nCurrently, parts of the crown, robe drapes, and left hand fingers are damaged, and the halo is lost. Rust is present on the face and right hand, but the gilding remains relatively intact. This statue exemplifies the typical style of mid-7th century Silla gilt-bronze Bodhisattva sculptures, showcasing exceptional balance and craftsmanship.",

Its overall shape closely resembles the modern outline of the Korean Peninsula, extending northward to Manchuria and southward to Jeju Island and Tsushima Island, reflecting Joseon's territorial consciousness during the period. Dated to approximately 1557–1558 (12th–13th years of King Myeongjong's reign), the map was taken to Japan during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and preserved in Tsushima before being acquired in the 1930s.

Originally named 'Seoru' (West Pavilion), it was renamed 'Jukseoru' (Bamboo-West Pavilion) in the late 14th century. Historical records, including Kim Su-on's *Jukseoru Dancheonggi* (1472) and Heo Mok's *Jukseoru Gi* (1662), indicate that Governor Kim Hyo-son (1373–1429) rebuilt the pavilion on its original site in 1403. Although it underwent multiple repairs and expansions after its reconstruction in the early Joseon period, its original form from the late Joseon era has been well preserved. The name 'Jukseoru' is derived from its location west of Jukjangsa Temple, as noted by Heo Mok.\n\nThe pavilion was initially a five-kan (front) by two-kan (side) structure rebuilt in 1403. It was expanded to three-kan on the south side in 1530 and two-kan on the north side in 1788, resulting in its current hipped-and-gabled (paljak) roof form. The central five-kan section from the early Joseon period and the later additions on the left and right exhibit distinct architectural features in column arrangements, structural framing, ceiling treatments, bracket systems, and decorative details.\n\nThirteen of the 22 pillars stand directly on natural bedrock, while nine are supported by stone foundations. The southern expansion retains exposed natural rock flooring, with only the central kan paved for accessibility. The interior features an open layout without walls or partitions, with exposed rafters (yeondeung ceiling) and grid-patterned (ungmul) ceilings. The floor is constructed with a grid-style wooden plank (ungmul maru) system, flanked by railings to prevent falls.\n\nThe pavilion once housed numerous plaques inscribed with poems by King Sukjong, King Jeongjo, and prominent literati, though many were lost during the 1959 Typhoon Sarah. Twenty-eight plaques remain, including the 1710 inscriptions 'Jukseoru' and 'Gwandong Jeilru' (First Pavilion of Gwandong) by Governor Lee Seong-jo. Literary works such as Jeong Cheol's *Gwandong Byeolgok* and paintings by Jeong Seon (*Gwandong Myeongseungcheop*, 1676–1759), Kim Hong-do (1745–1806+), and Kang Se-hwang (1713–1791) further attest to its cultural significance.\n\nSamcheok Jukseoru holds immense historical value due to well-documented construction and expansion dates, architectural evolution across eras, and its association with literary and artistic legacies.

The pagoda follows the typical Unified Silla style, featuring a three-tiered body atop a two-tiered base. The lower base is adorned with celestial beings (天人像) in flowing garments, while the upper base depicts the Eight Legions of Divine Beings (八部神衆) seated on clouds, brandishing weapons in a majestic posture. Each tier's body and roof stones are carved from single blocks, with the first-tier body stone featuring various Buddhist images. The roof stones have slightly uplifted eaves at the corners, enhancing their graceful beauty, and are supported by five-tiered bases. Only the finial base remains atop the third-tier roof stone, as the original ornamental elements have been lost. Balanced in composition, this pagoda is one of the representative stone pagodas of the Unified Silla period. The exquisite carvings on the base and the sophisticated Buddhist images on the first-tier body stone evoke the former splendor of Jinjeonsa Temple.",

The Palsangjeon Hall is the only remaining five-story wooden pagoda in Korea. The current structure was rebuilt after the Imjin War (1592-1598) and underwent dismantling and restoration in 1968. Its name derives from the 'Eight Scenes of the Buddha's Life' (Pal Sang-do), which are painted on the walls, depicting eight key moments from the Buddha's life.\n\nThe architectural design varies by floor: the first and second floors have five bays (front and side), the third and fourth have three bays, and the fifth has two bays. Stone staircases on all four sides and a low foundation contribute to its stability despite its height. The roof features a pyramidal (samo) style with a finial atop. Structurally, the first to fourth floors use the jusimpo bracket system (supports placed only above columns), while the fifth floor employs the dapo bracket system (supports between columns as well).\n\nInternally, the hall houses a space for enshrining sarira relics, Buddha statues, the Eight Scenes paintings, and an area for worship. As the tallest surviving tower and the sole wooden pagoda in Korea, the Palsangjeon Hall holds immense historical and architectural significance.",

The upper pillars exhibit a creative design reminiscent of the stone railings at Bulguksa Temple's Dabotap Pagoda, preserving an archaic aesthetic. The lower railing wall is further embellished with intricate patterns, enhancing its ornate beauty.

During a 1917 restoration, relics and a Goryeo-era mirror were discovered in the sixth-story body and base, suggesting a secondary enshrinement during the Goryeo period. Though grand in scale, the pagoda appears less stable due to its height-to-width ratio, with some scholars attributing this to alterations made during Japanese colonial-era repairs, which may have compromised its original structural integrity and detailing.",

It is the oldest and most uniquely shaped stone structure carved with lions. Resting on an octagonal base, two lions face each other, pressing their chests together and standing on the lower stone with their hind legs, while supporting the upper stone with their front paws and muzzles. Lotus patterns are engraved on both the lower and upper stones, with the double-layered lotus design on the upper stone exuding an antique charm.

The octagonal fire chamber (hwasaseok) is tall with four openings to allow light to emanate. The roof stone, horizontal at the eaves but slightly uplifted at the eight corners, appears modest and stable due to its unadorned simplicity. Dated to 720 CE (19th year of King Seongdeok's reign), the lantern's proportions—though the roof stone appears slightly large—create a harmonious balance with the broad base, radiating a dignified grandeur. Unlike typical Unified Silla stone lanterns that used octagonal pillars, this innovative design substitutes them with twin lions, a pioneering approach that inspired later imitations.

Erected after Silla occupied the Goguryeo territory of Jeokseong, it was intended to stabilize the local populace. Discovered in 1978, the stele was found buried underground in a tilted state, with its inscription remarkably well-preserved. The stele is wide and thick at the top, narrowing and thinning toward the bottom. Though the upper portion is missing, both sides remain nearly intact, suggesting it was crafted from a natural stone with a freeform shape. The total number of characters is estimated at around 440, with 288 legible characters remaining today. The calligraphy aligns precisely with horizontal and vertical lines in each row, showcasing a rhythmic brushwork style transitioning from clerical script (Lishu) to regular script (Kaishu), making it a valuable resource for calligraphic studies. The inscription commends the people of Jeokseong who aided Silla's territorial expansion and pledged loyalty, while promising equal rewards to future loyalists. This reveals new insights into the development of Silla's legal system (Yulryeong), particularly regarding penal and administrative laws. It highlights that national laws on labor systems and property distribution were established early in King Jinheung's reign, with local customs of Jeokseong generalized into legal statutes. By comparing the ranks of ten high officials mentioned in the inscription with records from the Samguk Sagi, the stele is dated to between the 6th and 11th years of King Jinheung's reign (545–550 CE). Its placement in Jeokseong, a strategic stronghold for northern expeditions, reflects Silla's intent to affirm control over new territory and integrate subjugated Goguryeo populations. Though not a pure memorial stele (erected to commemorate a king's inspection tour), it holds significant value as a territorial expansion stele, embodying the spirit of such monuments.",

      "content_en": "This book is a handwritten diary composed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin (1545–1598) during the Imjin War (1592–1598), consisting of seven volumes organized by year. Yi Sun-sin failed the military selection exam (Hunlwon Byeol-gwa) at age 28 due to a horse accident but passed the civil service exam four years later, beginning his career as a government official. Renowned for his exceptional loyalty, literary talent, and poetic skills, he prepared for Japanese invasion as Commander of the Jeolla Left Naval District by constructing warships and strengthening military defenses in Yeosu. During the Imjin War, he achieved decisive victories at battles such as Okpo, Sacheon (where the Geobukseon turtle ship debuted), Danghangpo, and Hansan. In the Japanese re-invasion (Jeongyu Jaeran), he triumphed at Myeongnyang. Posthumously honored as a First-Class Meritorious Subject of Martial Valor in 1604, he was posthumously promoted to Prime Minister and granted the posthumous title 'Chungmu' (忠武). His unwavering loyalty, moral integrity, and leadership saved the nation from crisis, leaving an indelible legacy in Korean history.\n\nThe diary's structure includes: Volume 1 (Imjin Ilgi, 27 pages, May 1, 1592–March 1593), Volume 2 (Gyesha Ilgi, 30 pages, May–September 1593), Volume 3 (Gapo Ilgi, 52 pages, January–July 1594), Volume 4 (Byeongsin Ilgi, 41 pages, January–October 1596), Volume 5 (Jeongyu Ilgi, 27 pages, April–October 1597), Volume 6 (Jeongyu Ilgi Sok, 20 pages with partial overlap, August 1597–January 1598), and Volume 7 (Musun Ilgi, 8 pages, September–October 1598). Written intermittently during seven years of war, it was preserved by descendants for over 390 years. As the original draft of the diary included in Chungmu Gong Jeonseo, it contains detailed military strategies, naval control records, and drafts of battle reports, offering invaluable insights into Joseon's military system and wartime operations.",

      "content_en": "Enshrined in the Upper Daeungjeon Hall (Treasure) of Janggeosa Temple, located on Mount Chilgap in Cheongyang County, Chungcheongnam-do, this iron Buddha statue sits majestically on a massive square stone pedestal. The statue is backed by a wooden halo, replacing the original stone halo which was lost. The Buddha's usnisa (topknot) is modestly rendered, and the face exhibits a round, refined appearance. Though the body is robust and dignified, the lack of volumetric fullness and reduced elastic proportions suggest it was crafted in the late 9th century. The right hand touches the ground in a gesture of earth witness, while the left hand, originally holding a medicine vase (now missing), rests on the lap. The monastic robe, loosely draped over the left shoulder, features sparse and scattered folds.\n\nThe four-sided pedestal, far more grandiose than the statue itself, comprises three tiers: a broad, tall base; a relatively low and small middle tier; and an upper tier. The base stone is exceptionally wide, with traces of pillars at each corner, indicating the presence of an enclosed shrine space. The lower tier is adorned with inverted lotus patterns and large floral carvings at the corners. The middle tier features prominent eye-shaped motifs (ansang), while the upper tier displays blooming lotus patterns.\n\nThe wooden halo, likely a Joseon-era replacement for the original stone version, incorporates floral designs at the center and flame patterns around the edges, reflecting stylistic influences from the late Silla to early Goryeo periods. This statue is acclaimed as an outstanding example of early 10th-century Buddhist art, inheriting the late 9th-century style through its unique pedestal resembling a pagoda, niche-like structure, and elegant iron-casting technique.",

The reliquary measures 74 cm in height and 50 cm in width and length, featuring a circular top and a flat, tunnel-shaped base. The inner chamber, carved to a depth of approximately 45 cm, includes ledges suggesting the installation of a sarira apparatus and a door. Inscribed on both sides of the chamber are 10 characters each in a clerical script (隸書) style from China's Northern and Southern Dynasties. The epigraph reveals that the reliquary was created in 567 by King Chang (r. 554–598, also known as King Wideok), son of King Seong, to honor the sarira offered by a princess—daughter of King Seong and sister of King Chang. This artifact serves as a critical epigraphic resource for Baekje history, illustrating cultural exchanges between Baekje and China. Additionally, it is historically significant as the first confirmed case where the founding date of a Baekje temple is verified through contemporary artifacts, clarifying the chronology of Buddhist practices in the kingdom.",

The statue features a tall cylindrical crown atop neatly combed hair and holds a bronze lotus flower in both hands. Its broad, distinct facial features and unconventional, overwhelming scale exemplify a uniquely Korean aesthetic sensibility, diverging sharply from the refined idealism of Unified Silla sculpture.

These tablets, discovered alongside the tomb in 1971, serve as 'maejigwon' (land deed inscriptions) addressed to the earth deity, formalizing the acquisition of the tomb site. The king's stele measures 41.5 cm in width and 35 cm in height, with an inscription divided into six lines within a 5–6 cm border. Its text aligns with records from the Samguk Sagi. The reverse side features a square grid marking the 12 compass directions, though the western section is notably absent. The queen's stele, identical in size, bears a 4-line inscription within a 2.5–2.8 cm border, with the remaining 13 lines left blank. Its reverse side contains the land purchase text (maejimun). Originally created for King Muryeong's burial, the reverse was later reused to inscribe the queen's epitaph upon her interment. As the sole surviving 'maejigwon' from the Three Kingdoms period, these steles are invaluable for identifying tomb occupants and understanding Baekje burial practices.

      "content_en": "Designated as a Treasure in 1963, this Gilt-bronze Seated Bhaisajyaguru Buddha from Janggeosa Temple in Cheongyang gained further historical significance following the discovery of its votive inscription and enshrined relics. The inscription specifies the exact production date as 1346 (2nd year of King Chungmok's reign in Goryeo), establishing it as an absolute benchmark for studying late Goryeo Buddhist statues. The statue exemplifies the iconography of Bhaisajyaguru (Medicine Buddha) with a distinct medicine bowl mudra, while its head, facial features, and bodily proportions reflect the quintessential stylistic traits of 14th-century Buddhist sculpture. Notably, it showcases exceptional artistic craftsmanship and technical mastery, with minimal casting flaws both internally and externally. Unlike most late Goryeo statues linked to Amitabha Pure Land devotion, this is the only surviving gilt-bronze Bhaisajyaguru statue from the period, offering critical insights into both Amitabha and Bhaisajyaguru faith traditions. The enshrined relics include a votive text listing 1,116 patrons—the largest recorded in late Goryeo—providing invaluable data for reconstructing historical narratives due to the scarcity of contemporary documents. Among the patrons is Baegun Kyŏnghan (1298–1374), a key figure in the Goryeo Buddhist triad (alongside Naong Hyegeun and Taego Bou), whose previously obscure activities are now illuminated through this inscription. The patrons, including royal figures and lower-ranking military officials, likely commissioned the statue to pray for longevity and the salvation of relatives lost in Mongol invasions. Mongolian names like Bayan Temür (King Gongmin's Mongol name) and others in the list also attest to the cultural influence of the Yuan dynasty in 14th-century Korea. Accompanied by silk fragments with donor inscriptions, a high-quality incense pouch, and the votive text, this statue holds profound value not only in art history but also in Buddhist studies and social history, vividly capturing the era's religious, artistic, and socio-political landscape. These attributes collectively affirm its eligibility for national treasure status.",

The pagoda stands on a high terrace northwest of the temple, surrounded by pine forests, facing the stone lantern. It features a three-story tower body atop a two-tiered base. The lower base is adorned with protruding carvings of celestial beings (cheonin) playing musical instruments, holding flowers, and dancing in praise. The upper base, the most notable section, is supported by four lions—two male and two female—at each corner, all gazing forward with open mouths revealing sharp teeth. At the center, encircled by the lions, stands a monk in a praying posture, believed to represent Monk Yeon Gi's mother. Directly ahead, a kneeling monk statue faces the stone lantern, symbolizing Yeon Gi's profound filial piety as he offers tea to his mother while bearing the lantern.

At the center sits Amitabha Buddha, flanked by Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva on the left and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva on the right. Above the scene, six arhats are arranged in pairs on either side against a cloudy backdrop, with two small buddhas painted above them. The composition mirrors the enshrined Amitabha Triad statue in front. The central Buddha is seated cross-legged on a high lotus pedestal, draped in robes covering both shoulders, with a key-shaped halo behind. Avalokiteshvara, with flowing hair and a translucent outer robe, stands to the left, while Ksitigarbha on the right holds a monk’s staff in his right hand and a wish-fulfilling jewel in his left. The palette primarily uses green and red hues. Created in 1476 (7th year of King Seongjong’s reign) by the painter-monk Haeryeon, the mural retains Goryeo-era characteristics such as soft coloration and naturalistic body forms. Simultaneously, it exhibits early Joseon features like simplified patterns and figures proportionate to the main Buddha, making it a critical resource for studying the transition between Goryeo and early Joseon Buddhist art.",

The composition exemplifies a well-structured symmetry, with both upper and lower sections mirroring each other. The lower portion centers on the First Assembly, the 'Bodhi Field Assembly,' flanked by the 7th, 2nd, and 8th assemblies on the left and the 9th 'Seodarim Assembly' on the right. The upper section ascends from the 3rd 'Trayastrimsa Heaven Assembly' and 4th 'Yama Heaven Assembly' on the right to the 5th 'Tusita Heaven Assembly' and 6th 'Tahojai Heaven Assembly' on the left, maintaining balanced symmetry. The use of ochre, red, green, and gold on a mineral-pigmented silk ground, along with high-relief ornamentation on the jeweled adornments of the Buddha figures, reflects the vibrant aesthetic trends of 18th-century Buddhist painting. Notably, the lower register includes the 'Illustration of the Lotus Realm,' which visualizes the 39th chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra, where Samantabhadra Bodhisattva explains the pure land of Vairocana Buddha. Historical records indicate the painting was created in 1770 (46th year of King Yeongjo's reign) by 12 monk-artists led by Hwaryeon at Ansimsa Temple on Mount Mudeung, later relocated to Songgwangsa. As the earliest extant Joseon-era Avatamsaka Sutra illustration, it holds significant scholarly value for its meticulous and effective depiction of the sutra's doctrinal content.",

It holds historical significance as the central naval base that contributed to the victories in the Imjin and Jeongyu Wars, and retains its original form from its renovation in 1718 (44th year of King Sukjong's reign) by Naval Commander Lee Je-myeon. With a scale of 15 kan (bays) in width, 5 kan in depth, and a total area of 240 pyeong, it is the largest surviving local government building in Korea.\n\nThe structure's plan consists of 68 pillars. The inner pillars at the second bay on both eastern and western sides were relocated forward, treated as high pillars (goju) that directly support the main beam (jongbo). Cross beams (daeryang) are joined to these high pillars with bracket systems (pojak), and eave beams (tuibo) are placed above. Between the inner and outer pillars on the front and rear, simple eave brackets (tuiryang) are installed, while two cross beams (chungryang) on the side bays extend inward, their ends adorned with dragon-head carvings (yongdu) resting on the cross beams.\n\nThe pillars exhibit the min-heulrim tapering technique. Externally, the bracket system follows a multi-tiered (dapogui) style with two-tiered brackets (chumok) and decorative lotus-bud motifs, while internally it adopts a simpler ikong-style bracket system using overlapping wooden blocks (salmi). The front central pillars feature dragon-head brackets (yongmeori ikchogong). Each bay is accentuated with a floral bracket (hwanban), enhancing the façade's spatial composition. Original dancheong (traditional multicolored paintwork) patterns remain well-preserved on both interior and exterior elements.\n\nTo maximize interior space, the high pillars on both sides were set backward, optimizing functionality while maintaining structural integrity. The use of robust yet minimalist materials contributes to the building's grandeur. Additionally, two cross beams on the side façades ensure stability, reflecting advanced 18th-century architectural techniques. Despite its early 18th-century reconstruction, Yeosu Jinnamgwan exemplifies exceptional historical, academic, and artistic value.",

The set comprises one Yeongsanhoesangdo (Assembly on Vulture Peak Painting) and eight Pal Sangdo (Eight Scenes of the Buddha’s Life). Notably, the inscription on the Yeongsanhoesangdo uses the term 'Pal Sanghoe' (Eight Scenes Painting) instead of 'Hwabuldo' (Back Buddha Painting), emphasizing that this Yeongsanhoesangdo was produced as the central image alongside the Pal Sangdo series.\n\nThe Pal Sangdo depict eight pivotal events in the life of Sakyamuni Buddha. While the concept of the Eight Scenes was shared across Buddhist cultures, their thematic composition and iconography varied by region. In Korea, the specific sequence of the Eight Scenes—① Tosalraeuisang (Descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven), ② Biramgangsaengsang (Birth in Lumbini Garden), ③ Samunyugwangsang (Observing Suffering at the Four Gates), ④ Yuseongchulgasang (Leaving Home), ⑤ Seolsansudosang (Ascetic Practice in the Snow Mountains), ⑥ Suha Hangmasang (Subduing Mara under the Bodhi Tree), ⑦ Nokwonjeonbopsang (First Sermon in Deer Park), and ⑧ Ssangrimyeolbansang (Parinirvana in the Twin Groves)—was formally established in the early Joseon period, as illustrated in the iconic depictions of the *Worin Seokbo* (Moonlight Reflection on the Buddha’s Biography).\n\nDuring the late Joseon period, a new style of Pal Sangdo emerged, influenced by the *Seokssi Wonryu Eungwasajeok* (Chronicle of the Buddha’s Lineage and Manifestations). The Songgwangsa Pal Sangdo exemplifies this shift, with inscriptions confirming their creation in 1725 (1st year of King Yeongjo’s reign) under the lead painter Uigyeom (義謙).\n\nHoused in the Songgwangsa Seongbo Museum, this ensemble is the earliest known complete set of Yeongsanhoesangdo and Pal Sangdo enshrined together in a single hall. It reflects Joseon’s unique approach to visualizing the Buddha’s life through Buddhist art. Significantly, both the Yeongsanhoesangdo and Pal Sangdo employ iconography from the *Seokssi Wonryu Eungwasajeok*, forming a cohesive conceptual and artistic whole. This work not only highlights the diversity of late Joseon Yeongsanhoesangdo but also establishes a new paradigm for Pal Sangdo.

Created in 1635 (13th year of King Injo's reign) during the late Joseon period, these statues represent a collaborative masterpiece by renowned sculptors Cheongheon (also known as Cheongheon), Ungwon, In-gyun, and their disciples. They stand as a quintessential example of 17th-century Buddhist sculpture. The 'Trijang Buddha' refers to the three bodies of Buddha: Dharmakaya (Vairocana), Sambhogakaya (Rohmani), and Nirmanakaya (Sakyamuni), a iconography rooted in Hwaeom (Huayan) Buddhist thought. While commonly depicted in paintings or sutra illustrations, these statues are the only surviving sculptural representation of the Trijang Buddha, making them an indispensable case study in the history of post-Imjin War Buddhist ideology and sculpture. Recent discoveries of relic documents and inscriptions have clarified the production timeline (1634–1635), patrons, and participants. Commissioned during the temple's post-war reconstruction (1630–1636), the project was overseen by Monk Byeokam Gakseong (1575–1660), an influential figure who led the restoration of major temples devastated by the Imjin War. Notable patrons included Prince Uichang Lee Hwang (1589–1645), King Seonjo's eighth son, his spouse, Sin Ik-sung (1588–1644), King Seonjo's son-in-law, and 1,320 donors, including 580 monks. The statues, seated on elaborate lotus pedestals and octagonal wooden thrones, exceed 3 meters in height. Their monumental scale and robust, simplified lines reflect the sculptors' mastery. The Vairocana and Sakyamuni statues, with stern expressions, are attributed to Cheongheon's school, while the Rohmani statue, characterized by softer facial features and rounded eyelids, is linked to Ungwon and In-gyun. As the largest 17th-century wooden Buddhist statues and the sole sculptural Trijang Buddha ensemble, these works hold unparalleled significance in Buddhist art history, showcasing exceptional artistic and technical achievement.",

According to the Samguk Yusa (三國遺事), Kim Daeseong built Seokguram Grotto to honor his past-life parents and Bulguksa to honor his present-life parents. However, he did not live to see its completion, and the state later finished the temple, designating it as a site for national prayers. \n\nThe Dabotap Pagoda and Sakyamuni Pagoda (Three-story Stone Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple, National Treasure) are Korea's most representative stone pagodas, with similar heights of 10.29m and 10.75m, respectively. They face each other between Daeungjeon Hall and Jahamun Gate, with Dabotap located to the east. Dabotap represents a unique pagoda style, while Sakyamuni Pagoda exemplifies the conventional Korean stone pagoda form. Their symmetrical placement symbolizes the Lotus Sutra's narrative, where Prabhutaratna Buddha (the Buddha of the past) attests to the teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha (the Buddha of the present). \n\nUnlike Sakyamuni Pagoda, which clearly has a three-tier structure on a two-tiered base, Dabotap's layers are difficult to discern. Its cross-shaped base features stone staircases on all four sides, an octagonal tower body, and a square railing. Constructed around 751, the pagoda ingeniously integrates square, octagonal, and circular elements without appearing cluttered, reflecting the essence of 8th-century Unified Silla artistry. The uniform proportions of its components—length, width, and thickness—highlight its meticulous design. \n\nTragically, Dabotap bears the scars of Japanese colonial rule. Around 1925, Japanese authorities dismantled and restored the pagoda without documenting the process, resulting in the loss of relics, sarira, and related artifacts originally housed within. Additionally, three of the four stone lions that once guarded the base's staircases were looted during this period.

The robust two-tiered base is designed to bear the pagoda's weight, with carved pillar motifs at each corner mimicking wooden architecture. Similar pillars adorn the tower body, and the upturned corners of the roof stones impart a dynamic, soaring aesthetic.\n\nIn September 1966, the pagoda was damaged by tomb raiders.

Originally named Seokbulsa, it stands as a masterpiece of Silla Buddhist art. King Gyeongdeok (r. 742–765) presided over a golden age of Buddhist culture, during which other iconic heritage sites like Bulguksa Temple, Dabotap Pagoda, Three-story Stone Pagoda, and Hwangnyongsa Bell were also created.\n\nCarved into the slopes of Tohamsan Mountain using white granite, the grotto features an artificial stone chamber. The structure comprises a rectangular antechamber (jeonsil) connected by a corridor to a circular main chamber (jushil), with the latter's dome crafted from 360 interlocking stone slabs—a globally unparalleled architectural feat. Though originally housing 40 statues, only 38 remain today.\n\nThe antechamber displays eight guardian deities (four on each side), while the corridor entrance features Vajra guardians and the Four Heavenly Kings. The main chamber, supported by octagonal pillars, enshrines the principal Buddha (Shakyamuni) slightly rearward of the center. Its walls depict two celestial beings, two bodhisattvas, ten arhats, and the intricately carved Eleven-Headed Kwanum Bodhisattva behind the main statue.\n\nRenowned for its mature sculptural techniques and lifelike expressions, Seokguram's artworks—including the serene main Buddha, the ornate Eleven-Headed Kwanum, dynamic Vajra guardians, imposing Heavenly Kings, graceful bodhisattvas, and individualistic arhats—are considered pinnacles of East Asian Buddhist sculpture. The grotto's harmonious integration of architecture, mathematics, religion, and art earned it National Treasure status and UNESCO World Heritage designation (jointly with Bulguksa) in 1995. Due to preservation concerns, public viewing through glass barriers has been implemented since 1976.",

The cylindrical section is constructed with 27 layers of fan-shaped stones, featuring a smoothly finished exterior and a rough interior with protruding stone roots.

The cross-shaped top platform has long interlocking stones protruding outward. Similar structural features are found at the 19th–20th and 25th–26th layers, likely used to support ladders for ascent. Historical records indicate observers climbed through the window using external ladders and internal steps to reach the top for celestial observations. Astronomy was closely tied to agriculture, as celestial patterns dictated farming schedules, and to politics, as astrology (占星術) was used to predict national fortune.

The title 'Jingbi' signifies 'to discipline in advance and be wary of future calamities.' Yu Seong-ryong, a disciple of Toegye Yi Hwang and a contemporary of Kim Seong-il, passed the civil service examination in 1566. He held key positions, including Minister of Personnel, Minister of War, and Chief State Councilor, and played a pivotal role in recommending generals Gwon Yul and Yi Sun-sin. He also advocated for military reforms, such as weapon production, fortress construction, and naval strengthening. Renowned for his scholarly and calligraphic achievements, he was posthumously honored with the title 'Munchung' and enshrined at Byeongsan Seowon in Andong.\n\nWritten during Yu's retirement, Jingbirok provides a meticulous account of pre-war Japan-Joseon relations, Ming Dynasty's military aid, and naval strategies. The manuscript was first published in 1647 (16 volumes, 7 books) under the supervision of Jo Su-yuk, then reprinted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1695. Its historical value led to a royal ban on its export to Japan in 1712. Alongside Nanjung Ilgi (Yi Sun-sin's war diary), Jingbirok remains an indispensable primary source for studying the Imjin War.",

Found within the pagoda's sarira chamber were an outer sarira case, silver inner and outer sarira containers shaped like spheres, a gilt-bronze sarira case, the Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong (The Great Dharani Sutra on Unceasing Light), various beads, and other artifacts. Surrounding the sarira case were bronze flying celestial figures, a complete and a quartered bronze mirror, wooden pagodas, jade beads, glass beads, and incense wood. At the base of the sarira case, a bundle of paper wrapped in silk was found, though the text was illegible due to deterioration.\n\nThe outer sarira case features symmetrical vine patterns pierced on all four sides, with similar designs on its base. The roof is adorned with vine motifs and lotus decorations at the apex, corners, and ridges, while leaf-shaped ornaments hang from the eaves. This 8th-century masterpiece showcases intricate openwork and inlaid jewels. The silver inner and outer containers, gilded and egg-shaped, display lavish lotus patterns and fish-roe motifs (eozamun) characteristic of mid-8th-century craftsmanship.\n\nThe gilt-bronze square sarira case bears line-engraved depictions of a pagoda flanked by bodhisattvas on its front and back, and guardian kings (Inwang) on its sides. Its lid features a three-tiered pagoda finial, and inside rests a small sarira bottle carved from sandalwood.\n\nThe Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong, printed on a scroll approximately 8 cm wide and 620 cm long with 8–9 characters per line, is recognized as the world's oldest extant woodblock-printed text, dating to the mid-8th century. Severely damaged upon discovery, it underwent full restoration between 1988 and 1989. The sutra is linked to the 751 CE reconstruction of Bulguksa Temple, with characters used exclusively during Empress Wu Zetian's reign (690–705 CE) aiding in its chronological attribution.",

Each pagoda features a three-tiered tower body (tapseong) atop a two-tiered base (gidan), sharing identical scale and style. This twin-pagoda arrangement marks the earliest known example of a dual-tower temple layout (sangtapgaram) in Silla, emerging shortly after the unification of the Three Kingdoms. \n\nGamunsa Temple was commissioned by King Munmu, who unified the Three Kingdoms, to establish national prestige and harness Buddhist power to repel Japanese pirates frequently attacking the eastern coast. The temple was constructed near the East Sea, though King Munmu did not live to see its completion. His son, King Sinmun, fulfilled his father's vision, completing the temple in 682 CE, the second year of his reign. Reflecting this patriotic Buddhist ideology, the pagodas were designed to embody grandeur, solemnity, and vigor. \n\nA distinctive feature of these pagodas is their construction from multiple assembled stone blocks, diverging from earlier monolithic designs. The West Pagoda yielded significant artifacts during its 1960 restoration: a gilded bronze sarira reliquary (Treasure) and its outer case (Treasure). As the tallest three-story stone pagodas in Gyeongju, they stand firmly on an elevated site overlooking the East Sea, symbolizing Korea's architectural mastery and serving as iconic representations of traditional Korean stone pagodas.",

Volume 3, missing its first six pages, contains 50 pages; Volume 4 has 31 pages; and Volume 5, lacking its final four pages, comprises 26 pages, totaling 107 pages. Notable instances of pi-hwi (avoidance of using certain characters out of respect for royal names) include substituting 'Yong (豊)' for 'Yong (隆, the name of Taejo's father)' and omitting a stroke from 'Mu (武, the name of King Hyejong)'. However, most pi-hwi conventions are absent, indicating this is a Joseon-era publication from the early 15th century. Compared to the widely referenced 1512 Jeongdeok edition printed in Gyeongju, this copy exhibits significant textual differences. As the earliest extant version of the Samguk Yusa, dated to the late 14th century (early Joseon period), it holds immense value for bibliographic studies and serves as a critical resource for correcting errors in the later Jeongdeok edition.",

The temple was destroyed during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and rebuilt in 1945. In the 1990s, numerous relics were found inside the wooden Buddha statue enshrined in the main hall. Historical records discovered with the statue confirmed it was crafted in 1458 (4th year of King Sejo’s reign) as the principal Buddha of a triad at Beopcheonsa Temple. The statue exhibits early Joseon Buddhist sculpture characteristics, such as the ushnisha (topknot) on the crown and drapery folds around the arms and abdomen. However, the exact location of Beopcheonsa Temple remains unclear, as the name appears in multiple regions across Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, and Jeolla provinces. Among the relics found inside the statue were a 'Buddha Statue Production Record' detailing its creation and list of donors, a 'Collected Buddhist Scriptures (Budojo Samgyeong Hapbu)', Buddhist talismans, and 14 items across seven categories. Additionally, 38 types of textiles, five incenses, five grains, and seven treasures (glass, amber, pearls, etc.) matching descriptions in the 1824 'Ancestral Ritual Text' (Josanggyeong) published by Ujeomsa Temple were uncovered. These relics not only date the statue to the early Joseon period but also serve as vital resources for bibliographic and textile studies due to their individual historical and artistic value.",

The stele's scale, tortoise pedestal, and dragon-topped capstone exemplify the typical style and craftsmanship of the late Unified Silla period. The inscription divides Silla's Buddhist history into three eras and meticulously records Master Jijeung's doctrinal lineage: Dosin → Beoprang → Sinhaeng → Junbeom → Hye-eun → Dohyeon. This makes the stele a critical primary source for studying late Silla Buddhist history, particularly the development of Seon (Zen) Buddhism. Composed by the eminent scholar and literary figure Choe Chi-won, it is celebrated as one of the 'Four Mountain Stele Inscriptions' alongside the Stele of Daeungyeongsa Temple, the National Treasure Stele of Nanghye Temple Site in Boryeong, and the National Treasure Stele of Sanggye Temple in Hadong. Its scholarly value has long been recognized. The stele also specifies its erection date and identifies Hye-gang, a monk from Bunhwangsa Temple, as the calligrapher, offering vital insights into Korean paleography. Unlike other biographical records, Choe Chi-won structures Master Jijeung's life into 'Six Divine Events' (육이) and 'Six Virtuous Deeds' (육시), a unique narrative feature absent in other epitaphs. Additionally, the inscription provides extensive data on late Silla's personal names, place names, official titles, temple names, systems, and customs, serving as a key resource for Silla historiography. Notably, it documents the royal land ideology (왕토사상), procedures for donating land to temples, and clarifies how Seon school establishments relied on local elites' patronage—details explicitly recorded here. It is the sole Silla-era stele detailing temple administrative roles (사직). Furthermore, it contains the only domestic record of Baekje's Sotdo (sacred groves). In summary, this stele holds immense value not only as a biographical record of Master Jijeung but also as a pivotal artifact for research on Korean ancient history, Silla Seon Buddhism, paleography, and literary history.",

This version was published during the reign of King Gojong of Goryeo (1237–1248). Known as the Goryeo Daejanggyeong due to its production period, it is also called the Palman Daejanggyeong (80,000 Wooden Printing Blocks) because it contains approximately 80,000 panels and 84,000 Buddhist teachings corresponding to the 84,000 human sufferings.\n\nThe creation of this Tripitaka was motivated by the destruction of the initial version (Ch'obo Daejanggyeong) during the Mongol invasion of 1232. The Goryeo government established a temporary agency, the Daejanggeom, to produce a new set, aiming to repel the Mongol forces through Buddhist spiritual power. The carving was overseen by the Branch Daejanggeom in Namhae, South Gyeongsang Province.\n\nOriginally stored at Daejanggyeong Pan-dang outside the west gate of Ganghwa Island, the blocks were later moved to Haedongseong and then to Haeinsa Temple in April 1398 (7th year of King Taejo of Joseon), where they remain today. Currently housed in Haeinsa’s Dharani Pavilion and Sudarajang, the collection comprises 81,258 panels according to a Japanese colonial-era survey, including some recarved during the Joseon period. Each panel measures approximately 70 cm in width, 24 cm in height, and 2.6–4 cm in thickness, weighing 3–4 kg.\n\nThe Tripitaka consists of 1,496 texts across 6,568 volumes. Its notable feature is the meticulous correction of errors by Sugi Daesa, a monk from Gaetaesa Temple, who referenced the Northern Song edition, Khitan version, and the initial Goryeo Tripitaka during production.\n\nAs the sole surviving record of the lost Northern Song and Khitan Tripitakas, these blocks are invaluable for their historical and scholarly significance. With no typographical or omissions errors across millions of characters, they represent unparalleled precision and completeness. Recognized for their historical depth and perfection, the Haeinsa Daejanggyeong Wooden Printing Blocks were inscribed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 2007.",

The region was incorporated into Silla in 555 (16th year of King Jinheung's reign) and later merged with Dayaju (present-day Hapcheon County) in 565, becoming known as Bisabalgun or Bijahwa-gun. The stele, originally located at the foot of Mokmasanseong Fortress, was relocated to its current site in 1924 and housed within a protective pavilion. Carved onto a flattened natural stone with a bordered frame, it differs from other 'pure steles' (commemorating royal inspections) by lacking the title '순수관경 (Peripatetic Governance),' hence its designation as a '척경비 (territorial annexation stele).'

The rounded junction between the mouth and body, along with a shallow rim on the base's edge, enhances stability. The near 1:1 ratio of height to width demonstrates balanced proportions. On the broad mouth's upper surface, six evenly spaced circles contain Sanskrit characters (beomja) in silver inlay, interspersed with cloud motifs.

This makes it the oldest surviving hyangwan in Korea, serving as a critical chronological reference for studying Goryeo-era incense burners.

The statue was enshrined alongside the Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong (無垢淨光大陀羅尼經, Sutra of the Pure Light Great Dharani) at Gwaneumam Hermitage of Seoknamamsu Temple (石南巖藪, an ancient temple site). As the oldest extant Vairocana Buddha in Korea with the jinin (智拳印, wisdom fist gesture), it holds paramount importance in the study of ancient Buddhist sculpture, particularly given the scarcity of dated materials from this period. The establishment of the jinin mudra in a Tathagata (如來形) form by 766 CE reflects evolving Buddhist thought and historical trends, marking a pivotal moment in East Asian Buddhist art. This statue is recognized as the earliest inscribed Vairocana Buddha with the jinin mudra in East Asia, offering invaluable iconographic and stylistic insights for Buddhist art history. Additionally, the inclusion of the Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong within the statue's enshrinement provides critical evidence of early practices in Korean Buddhist statue consecration rituals.",

Measuring 1,022.3×635 cm overall and 943×619 cm in the painted area, the scroll centers on Shakyamuni Buddha flanked by Manjusri and Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas. The Buddha, occupying the composition’s core, has a round, serene face and a dignified posture, with heavy robes draped over both shoulders. The chest features a prominent swastika symbol, while the red and green robes are adorned with vibrant floral patterns. The bodhisattvas, slightly smaller than the Buddha, hold lotus branches and wear elaborate headdresses. Their round faces, frontal stances, and recessed positioning behind the Buddha create a sense of depth. Rich hues of blue, sky-blue, and pink, combined with intricate floral motifs and jewelry, enhance their grandeur. Above the Buddha, figures of his disciples Ananda and Mahakasyapa, along with other buddhas, are depicted. Created in 1722 (2nd year of King Gyeongjong’s reign) by the monk painter Uigyeom (義謙) and collaborators, this gwaebul is celebrated for its dynamic composition, robust figures, luminous colors, and floral decorations, representing a masterpiece of early 18th-century Buddhist art. It is particularly noted for its triad of Shakyamuni, Manjusri, and Samantabhadra, drawing comparisons to the gwaebul of Yecheon Yongmunsa Temple, and remains a vital resource for Buddhist painting studies.",

The temple's name, 'Tongdosa' (通度寺), signifies 'attaining enlightenment through the Geungangkdae Altar' and guiding beings to paradise. The current structure was rebuilt in 1645 (23rd year of King Injo's reign in the Joseon Dynasty) after being destroyed during the Imjin War (1592–1598).\n\nThe Daewongjeon measures 3 kan (front) by 5 kan (side) with a unique T-shaped roof. Its multi-bracket (dapo) system supports the eaves, featuring decorative brackets both above columns and between them. The exterior base and stone staircases retain exquisite lotus carvings from the Unified Silla period. The Geungangkdae Altar, a sacred site for Buddhist ordination ceremonies, symbolizes the Buddha's perpetual presence. The current altar, repaired multiple times during the Goryeo and Joseon periods, follows Korea's traditional design, with a bell-shaped stone reliquary at its center. The inner side of the first-tier base depicts celestial beings, while the outer side features carvings of Indra, the guardian of Buddhist law.\n\nAs a mid-Joseon architectural exemplar with a confirmed construction date, the Daewongjeon is vital for architectural and historical studies. Together with the Geungangkdae Altar, which holds profound religious significance, they are esteemed as pivotal cultural heritage assets reflecting Korea's spiritual and artistic legacy.",

This statue is judged to have been created in the late 9th century, contemporaneous with the Wooden Seated Vairocana Buddha in Beopbojeon Hall, based on similarities in size and craftsmanship, a conclusion supported by scientific analysis. As the oldest surviving wooden Buddha statue in Korea, it holds immense historical and academic value. The enshrined relics date from the Goryeo to early Joseon periods, reflecting the temple's founding in 802 CE and indicating that the statue was crafted shortly after Haeinsa's establishment, undergoing multiple gilding and repairs. These relics, created under royal patronage, include rare texts and fabrics, serving as a representative example of early Joseon royal Buddhist votive objects. The statue features a dignified, balanced physique, a monk's robe draped over one shoulder and under the other arm, natural and elastic fabric folds, and the dharmachakra mudra (left index finger clasped by the right hand). Notably, it is carved from incense cedar, a rare material in Korean wooden statues, which are typically made of pine or ginkgo. Only three Korean statues, including this one and another at Haeinsa's Beopbojeon Hall, as well as a Goryeo-era wooden Avalokiteshvara statue at Bonggwangsa Temple in Andong, are known to use incense cedar. The statue's construction technique—using a single cylindrical log for the body with separately attached head and arms, and tightly curled hair made with clay and attached densely—exemplifies early joinery methods from the Goryeo period. This statue, embodying 9th-century stylistic traits, has remained a central object of worship at Haeinsa since its creation. Its significance lies in its status as a rare 9th-century relic at Haeinsa and as a symbol of the temple's Huayan Buddhist ideology. The enshrined relics, spanning Goryeo to early Joseon, provide critical insights into the statue's repair history, Buddhist practices, Haeinsa's royal connections, and relic enshrinement methods, affirming their exceptional academic value.

      "content_en": "The National Treasure 'Dry Lacquer Seated Portrait of Monk Hee-rang at Haeinsa Temple, Hapcheon' is a sculptural depiction of Monk Hee-rang (希朗大師, 10th century), a prominent Buddhist monk active during the late Silla to early Goryeo periods. As the only surviving portrait sculpture (祖師像; monk portrait) from Korea, it is estimated to have been created in the early 10th century during the Goryeo Dynasty. While numerous portrait sculptures of eminent monks were produced in contemporary China and Japan, such works are exceedingly rare in Korea, making this piece the sole extant example that realistically recreates the likeness of a historical religious figure. Monk Hee-rang, a scholar deeply versed in Hwaeom (華嚴) Buddhism, is said to have resided at Hee-rang-dae (希朗臺) within Haeinsa Temple, devoting himself to ascetic practice. He is also recognized as the mentor of King Taejo Wang Geon (王建), the founder of Goryeo, and played a pivotal role in the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms. Historical records from the Joseon Dynasty confirm that the sculpture was enshrined at Haeinsa Temple for centuries, moving through halls such as Haengdang (解行堂), Jinsangjeon (眞常殿), Josajeon (祖師殿), and Bojangjeon (寶藏殿). Accounts from late Joseon scholars, including Yi Deok-mu's (李德懋, 1741–1793) 'Gayasan-gi' (伽倻山記), further authenticate its provenance. The sculpture combines dry lacquer (乾漆) for the front—face, chest, hands, and knees—with wooden components for the back and base, showcasing advanced technical methods of the period. This hybrid technique is also observed in earlier Buddhist sculptures, such as the Treasure-designated 'Dry Lacquer Seated Bhaisajyaguru Buddha at Cheongnyangsa Temple, Bonghwa.' Unlike later Joseon-era monk portraits, which often adopt idealized forms, this piece stands out for its lifelike realism: a slender, life-sized physique, benevolent gaze, faint smile, and visible skeletal structure beneath aged skin evoke a vivid, almost living presence. A small hole in the chest, symbolizing his epithet 'Hyungyeol Gukin' (胸穴國人; 'Nation’s Chest-Hole'), is linked to a legend where Hee-rang allowed mosquitoes to draw blood from his chest to aid others' meditation. However, such chest holes often symbolize spiritual power, as seen in the 1024 Treasure-designated 'Portrait of Seungga Monk at Seunggasa Temple, Bukhansan.' The sculpture’s historical significance lies in its dual role as both a rare surviving example of early Goryeo portrait sculpture and a testament to Hee-rang’s contributions to Buddhist scholarship and national unification. Its artistic excellence, technical innovation, and embodiment of the monk’s spiritual essence render it a culturally invaluable artifact, warranting its designation as a National Treasure to ensure preservation and public recognition.",

      "content_en": "Yeongnamnu Pavilion traces its origins to a small pavilion called Geumbyeoknu, Soru, or Juknu, which was part of Yeongnamsa Temple established during the Unified Silla period. After the temple was abandoned in the Goryeo dynasty, the pavilion remained, and in 1365 (14th year of King Gongmin’s reign), it was rebuilt and renamed Yeongnamnu by Kim Ju, the magistrate of Miryang, marking the beginning of its role as an official pavilion. The Goryeo scholar Jeong Jisang (d. 1135) composed the classical Chinese poem 'Yeongnamsaru,' depicting the pavilion’s night view. During the early Joseon period, An Jil (d. 1447), the magistrate of Miryang, expanded the complex by adding a smaller pavilion to the west. In 1442, this structure was named Soru by Gwon Gi and later renamed Imgyeongdang (now Chimryugak) by Lee Chung-geol (1465–1527). In the same year, Kim Yeong-chu, another magistrate, built Manghodang as a guesthouse on the northeast side of Yeongnamnu. In 1542, Park Se-hu relocated Manghodang to the east of the main pavilion, renaming it Neungpakak, and Imgyeongdang became Chimryugak. By the mid-16th century, Yeongnamnu evolved into a complex centered on the main pavilion (Daeru) flanked by Chimryugak and Neungpakak. This layout is depicted in Lee Kyung-hong’s 16th-century painting 'Miryang Sibjigdo.' The complex was destroyed during the Imjin War (1592–1598) but underwent multiple reconstructions. In 1844, under magistrate Lee In-jae, the main pavilion was expanded, and Yeosu-gak (a connecting structure) was added, finalizing the current configuration. The entire area, including Yeongnamnu, was called Miryanggwan and served as a guesthouse for officials and visitors. The main pavilion (Daeru) is a large wooden structure with a 5×4 bay rectangular plan, 7-bay framework, hipped-and-gabled roof with extended eaves, and roof-end tiles. It features an open interior with a well-floor and railings on all sides. Neungpakak (3×2 bays, 5-bay framework) and Chimryugak (3×2 bays, 5-bay framework) are connected to Daeru via Yeosu-gak. The harmonious arrangement of these four buildings on sloped terrain showcases exceptional architectural aesthetics and integration with the surrounding landscape. Yeongnamnu’s scenic beauty inspired numerous literary works, with over 300 poems once displayed on its walls; 12 plaques remain today. Prominent calligraphic plaques include 'Yeongnamnu' by Jo Yun-hyeong (1725–1799), 'Gangjwa Ungbu' by Lee Yu-won (1814–1888), and 'Gyonomyongnu' by the same artist. Yeongnamnu holds significant historical value as it has retained its location since the 16th century, supported by extensive historical records.

The hall measures five bays wide and four bays deep, featuring a hipped-and-gabled (paljak) roof. Low walls along the sides and rear reflect Chinese architectural techniques. Facing Dae Seongjeon are Dongmu (East Shrine) and Seomu (West Shrine), erected in 1603–1604 (36th–37th years of King Seonjo), which house tablets of Confucius’s disciples and Chinese and Korean sages. Walls connecting Dongmu and Seomu demarcate the ritual and educational zones.\n\nMyeongnyundang, constructed in 1606 (39th year of King Seonjo), serves as the educational hall. Its central auditorium (jungdang) has a gabled (matchbet) roof, while the flanking wings (iksil) feature lower paljak roofs, symbolizing hierarchical order. The balanced roof lines and proportions exemplify traditional Korean architectural aesthetics. Dongjae and Seojae, long dormitory buildings facing Myeongnyundang, were used as student residences.\n\nSeoul Munmyo and Sungkyunkwan historically functioned as the center for Confucian rituals and education during the Joseon Dynasty.

Donhwamun is the oldest surviving wooden structure among palace main gates, constructed in May 1412 and renovated in 1609 (the first year of King Gwanghae's reign). Originally, the gate lacked a signboard, but during King Seongjong's reign, the scholar Seo Geo-jeong was commissioned to name it, after which the signboard was installed. The second-story gatehouse features bells and drums used to announce specific times: at noon (ogo), a drum was beaten; for the curfew (injeong), the bell was struck 28 times; and for the lifting of the curfew (paru), it was struck 33 times. Donhwamun is a south-facing structure with five bays on the front and two on the sides, featuring a three-door configuration with the side bays walled off. The central gate served as the royal entrance, while the left and right gates were used by high-ranking officials.

Simhui, who entered monastic life at age nine, founded Bongrimsa Temple in Changwon after years of ascetic practice.

He later delivered sermons to King Gyeongmyeong at court before returning to Bongrimsa to mentor disciples until his death at 68.

The tortoise's oversized head clutches a wish-fulfilling jewel, with remnants of horn sockets on its crown. Intricate cloud patterns surround the square socket on its back, designed to hold the stele. The body stone, partially restored using historical rubbings, bears the inscription composed by King Gyeongmyeong, with calligraphy by Hanggi (행기) and carving by Seonghyu (성휴).

While the exact origin and acquisition history are unknown, it is said to have been obtained from a Japanese individual during the colonial period. Traces of gilding remain across the surface, with patches of green patina. The head is adorned with small spiral-shaped hair curls, and a prominent usnisa (symbolic topknot) is present near the crown, though it is low in height. The face is square-shaped, with elongated eyes slanting sideways, a small nose and mouth, and plump, fleshy cheeks. This rounded yet flat facial appearance reflects the stylistic characteristics of Unified Silla period Buddhist statues. The broad robes draped over both shoulders flow downward, forming a U-shaped collar and enveloping the body. The chest features a depiction of an inner garment and a belt knot, a hallmark of Unified Silla Buddhist iconography. The right hand is raised with the palm facing outward, while the left hand extends downward, also displaying the palm—a gesture common in Buddhist symbolism. The back of the statue has large hollows at the top and bottom of the body, a technical feature associated with the casting methods of Unified Silla gilt-bronze buddhas. Overall, the statue exhibits a stocky, rounded physique with a disproportionately large head.

One of the pair was taken to Japan but was repatriated to South Korea in 1966 under the 1965 Korea-Japan Agreement, and is now housed in the National Museum of Korea. Dating to the 5th–6th century Silla period, the earrings feature a typical three-part structure: a main ring (jugori), a middle ornament, and a finishing decoration. The main ring, which hooks to the ear, is thick and robust, while the middle section is adorned with a slender, leaf-shaped pendant. The lowest part terminates in a heart-shaped leaf motif. The central ring is meticulously finished with thin gold plates at both ends, and the elongated leaf-shaped middle ornament is decorated with engraved linear patterns along its edges and center, enhancing its luxurious appearance. The heart-shaped leaf at the base is further embellished with double rows of engraved lines along its border and central vein, creating a striking three-dimensional effect and opulent aesthetic. This artifact holds significant value as a representative example of the Gyeongju-style tagwanisik (ring-shaped earrings), distinguished by its superior craftsmanship, excellent state of preservation, and its role in illustrating the stylistic evolution of Silla goldwork, influencing later designs such as those found in the Geumjo Chong and Bomun-dong Tombs.",

      "content_en": "The 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - Perseverance (安重根義士遺墨-忍耐)' is one of the calligraphic works collectively designated as cultural heritage. These pieces were created by Ahn Jung-geun (1879–1910) while he was imprisoned in Lushun Prison from February to March 1910, following his assassination of Ito Hirobumi, the architect of Japanese aggression against Korea, at Harbin Station on October 26, 1909. Ahn was executed on March 26, 1910. The works bear inscriptions on the left side reading 'Written in the Second (Third) Month of the Year Gyeongsul (1910), at Lushun Prison, by Ahn Jung-geun, a Citizen of the Korean Empire (庚戌二(三)月, 於旅順獄中, 大韓國人安重根書),' accompanied by a handprint seal (掌印).\n\nThe content of the calligraphy includes didactic passages from classical texts like the Analects (論語) and Records of the Grand Historian (史記), personal reflections, critiques of societal change, warnings to Japan, and inscriptions of others' study names (堂號). Most of these works were gifted to Japanese individuals involved in his imprisonment, such as prosecutors and guards. Notably, 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - If One Seeks Glory for East Asia, One Must First Reform State Policies; Delay Leads to Regret (安重根義士遺墨-欲報東洋先改政略時過失機追悔何及)' was received by Orida Tadashi (折田督), a former Russian-Japanese War correspondent who later worked at Lushun Prison. It was passed to his nephew, Orida Kanji (折田幹二), during the family's return to Japan after Korea's liberation in 1945 and donated to Dankook University on February 20, 1989. Another piece, 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - Loyalty in Words, Faithfulness in Action; Universal Virtue (安重根義士遺墨-言忠信行篤敬雖蠻貊亦足以有別乎)', was gifted by the grandson of a prison officer, Yagi Masazumi (八木正澄), to the Ahn Jung-geun Memorial Society in October 2002. Additionally, 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - National Security: Constant Anxiety (安重根義士遺墨-國家安危勞心焦思)' and 'Ahn Jung-geun's Calligraphic Work - Devotion to Country: The Soldier's Duty (安重根義士遺墨-爲國獻身軍人本分)' were inscribed as gifts for Prosecutor Yasuoka.",

Depicting him seated on a chair facing right, the painting portrays Kang Hyeon wearing an official hat and green ceremonial robes, seated on a chair adorned with a tiger skin. As the father of the literati artist Kang Se-hwang, Kang Hyeon held prominent positions such as Daijehak (Grand State Councilor) and Minister of Rites. The facial depiction employs fine lines to render shading around the eyes, nose, chin, and cheeks, effectively capturing the reddish complexion characteristic of an elderly figure. The clothing wrinkles are minimally rendered with unshaded lines, emphasizing the subject's dignified presence. This work exemplifies the conventional format and artistic techniques of 18th-century Joseon portraits, particularly through elements like the tiger skin on the chair.",

Created as preliminary sketches, the works demonstrate dynamic and elegant brushwork, capturing the figures with meticulous detail. Faces are rendered with delicate fine lines, while clothing incorporates a balanced use of thin and thick strokes.

The robe is crafted on a plain white silk ground, with intricate embroidery using techniques such as chain stitch (자련수), flat stitch (평수), and running stitch (선수), along with yellow and vermilion silk threads. Dated to the early 18th century, the kasaya bears an unidentified name on its reverse, though the individual's lifespan remains unverified. Among the approximately ten surviving kasayas from this period, this piece is uniquely distinguished as the only one entirely adorned with embroidered illustrations.",

The barrel is divided into six segments, with the three segments near the breech spaced narrower than those near the muzzle to prevent bursting from explosive force. The fluted design (양각) allows it to double as a club during close combat. The handle bears incised inscriptions (음각) detailing the manufacturing year, weight, and the artisan’s name, though the original wooden handle has deteriorated over time. According to the inscription, it was crafted in 1579 (12th year of King Seonjo’s reign) by Kim Ji, who served as the Jeolla Left Naval Commander and Gyeongsang Army Commander. As an early example of the Seungja Chongtong, this firearm holds significant historical value in the study of Korean arms manufacturing, demonstrating the development of portable firearms during the Joseon Dynasty.",

Large square holes on both shoulders suggest the presence of a wooden structure in front of the rock-carved Buddha. The statue features a prominent usnisa (topknot) on its bald head and a gentle yet dignified facial expression. The upper body is robust with broad shoulders, and a U-shaped chest reveals knots from the inner and outer robes. The clothing, draped over both shoulders, is rendered thicker than the body, showcasing a novel stylistic feature. The left arm is intricately carved with dense wave-like folds under the armpit, while the right arm has broader folds, creating a harmonious structural balance. In contrast, the lower body appears less stable. The right hand extends straight fingers to lightly grasp the robe, while the left hand is bent at the abdomen but holds no object. The mandorla (halo) is divided into head and body sections by two raised lines, with the body halo deeply engraved along the body's contour in a single line. Despite its simplified form and somewhat rudimentary details, the statue's rounded facial features and balanced proportions make it a representative rock-carved Buddha from the early Goryeo period.",

By the 12th century, Goryeo had established itself for over 200 years, with aristocratic culture at its zenith and a harmonious blend of Confucianism and Buddhism ensuring dynastic stability. This context necessitated a systematic review of earlier histories. The state, having repelled the Khitan, was confident but faced growing threats from the Jurchen, fostering a heightened national consciousness. Additionally, amid intense conflicts among aristocratic factions, the text emphasized division as a catalyst for collapse, aiming to critique contemporary issues and impart historical lessons.

The composition features three wild chrysanthemum sprigs branching in three directions atop rocks and grass depicted on the left side of the canvas. The artist distinguishes the rocks and petals with light ink, while the chrysanthemum leaves are rendered in dark ink, creating a harmonious contrast of tone and texture that imparts a lively vitality. The unembellished, understated treatment of the scene is a distinctive characteristic absent in works by other painters. Alongside the Treasure-designated King Jeongjo's Painting of Banana Leaves, this rare surviving example of Jeongjo's oeuvre holds significant value as a critical resource for the study of Korean art history.",

The central Buddha sits on a pedestal with a rounded face and robust physique, exuding a solemn and dignified presence. The robes drape over both shoulders, with a belt knot visible at the chest. The left hand extends downward, while the right hand is raised with all fingers curled. The bodhisattvas flanking the main Buddha wear crowns and bead decorations, holding lotus trays in their hands closest to the central figure. The dense vertical robe patterns on their lower garments are a characteristic feature of statues from the Yeongi area. The main Buddha's halo is circular, adorned with lotus and floral motifs, while the bodhisattvas' halos originally likely formed a boat shape, as suggested by the small Buddha and flame patterns above their heads. Each figure rests on a pedestal with inverted lotus designs. Though sharing stylistic elements with Yeongi's stele statues (carved Buddhist images or inscriptions on stele-shaped stones), the volumetric expression of the main Buddha and the posture of the bodhisattvas indicate this work dates to the late 7th century, showing slight technical advancement.",

It features detailed explanations of each verse by Song Dynasty monk Nammyeongcheon (Fachean). This woodblock-printed edition, transmitted on paper (27.5 cm x 16.6 cm), was recarved in 1239 (26th year of King Gojong of Goryeo) using a metal-type edition originally published by Choe Yi. The text includes a preface by Wu Yongtian Yong (1077) at the beginning and an epilogue by Chu Huang (1076) at the end. Choe Yi’s record notes that, despite the importance of the *Song of Enlightenment* in Seon Buddhism, it had been lost until he recreated the metal-type edition to preserve it for posterity. Wear on the characters suggests it was reprinted in the late Goryeo period, long after the original carving. The uneven and slanted arrangement of text reflects the use of assembled pre-existing characters for the printing blocks. Variations in character size and shape provide critical insights into early Korean metal-type printing techniques. Dated to at least the early 13th century, this text is vital for understanding the timeline and characteristics of Goryeo’s metal-type printing technology.",

This particular sword consists of a gold handle and an iron blade, though they are now separated; originally, they were attached. The handle is intricately carved with two intertwined dragons across its entire surface, and the ring also features two dragons with eyes inlaid with jade. Although only the iron blade remains, it is relatively well-preserved. Predominantly found in Silla tombs, the elaborate dragon designs suggest the sword belonged to a high-ranking noble.",

The concave dial features 7 vertical lines indicating hours and 13 horizontal lines marking seasons. As the sun moves from east to west, the shadow cast on the hour lines reveals the time. Additionally, the varying shadow lengths on the seasonal lines across the 24 solar terms reflect changes in the sun's altitude, allowing users to track the seasons. Notably, historical records in the *Annals of King Sejong* mention that 12 zodiac animal illustrations were added to help illiterate commoners read the time. Beyond its use in the palace, it holds significance as Korea's first public clock, installed at Hyijeonggyo Bridge in Jongno and near Jongmyo Shrine. Both sundials share an elegant, four-legged design with bronze bodies coated in black lacquer, featuring silver-inlaid inscriptions and lines. The cross-shaped legs ensure precise leveling. As a representative Joseon-era sundial and scientific cultural heritage, it remains a highly valued artifact.",

Created by the geographer and scholar Kim Jeong-ho (also known as Gosanja, dates unknown) in 1861 (12th year of King Cheoljong's reign), this map is regarded as the pinnacle of Joseon-era cartography and a masterpiece of traditional Korean maps. \n\nThe map is divided into 22 accordion-folded sections (분첩절첩식), which, when combined, form a large-scale representation of the entire Joseon territory. The first section includes a scale grid, a legend (지도표), a preface (지도유설), and maps of the northernmost regions of Onseong, Jongseong, and Gyeongwon. The preface historically examines the origins and importance of Chinese maps and geographical texts, emphasizing their necessity for politics, economy, defense, and academic research. It also outlines principles for accurate mapmaking. \n\nEach section covers an area of 80 ri (approx. 32 km) east-west and 120 ri (approx. 48 km) north-south. The woodblocks, estimated to number around 70, were engraved on both sides. When fully assembled, the map measures approximately 6.7 meters north-south and 3.8 meters east-west, with a scale of about 1:160,000. \n\nThe map meticulously depicts coastlines, islands, mountains, rivers, and administrative districts. Roads between counties are marked with dots every 10 ri for distance measurement. Within each county, key locations such as military offices (영아), county seats (읍치), fortresses (성지), military garrisons (진보), warehouses (창고), horse-breeding farms (목소), beacon stations (봉수), royal tombs (능침), villages (방리), and historical sites are labeled. \n\nKim Jeong-ho dedicated his life to cartography and geography, producing works like the Yeodo Biji, Dongyeodo Ji, Daedong Ji Ji, Cheonggudo (1834), and the Daedongyeojido. Unlike earlier hand-copied maps, the Daedongyeojido was printed from woodblocks, facilitating wider dissemination of geographical knowledge.

While some sections show traces of manual transcription, supplementation, and repairs—such as missing illustrations, prefaces, and parts of Volume 5 (pages 23–24)—as well as restored covers and annotations in the main text (e.g., Volume 1, page 14), it retains the original form of the woodblocks prior to later re-carving efforts. This makes it a critical bibliographic resource for verifying subsequent editions. Notably, Volumes 4–5 are not included in the previously designated Treasure editions of the same woodblock print, enhancing their rarity. Additionally, as an earlier printed version compared to existing designated artifacts, it holds significant academic value. Given these characteristics, the systematic preservation of this cultural asset is essential to maintain its historical and cultural significance.",

Created by the geographer and scholar Kim Jeong-ho (also known as Gosanja, dates unknown) in 1861 (12th year of King Cheoljong's reign), it represents the zenith of Joseon-era cartography and is celebrated as a masterpiece of historical maps.  \n\nThe map is divided into 22 folded sections (buncheop jeolcheop-sik), which, when assembled, form a comprehensive national map. Each section measures approximately 80 ri (32 km) east-west and 120 ri (48 km) north-south. The entire map spans about 6.7 meters north-south and 3.8 meters east-west, with a scale of approximately 1:160,000. It was printed using around 70 woodblocks, each engraved on both sides.  \n\nThe first section includes a grid system (bang-an-pyo), a legend (jido-pyo), a preface (jido-yuseol), and a detailed map of the capital region (Gyeongdo Obu-jido), alongside maps of the northernmost areas of Onseong, Jongseong, and Gyeongwon. The jido-yuseol emphasizes the historical and practical importance of maps and geographical records for politics, economy, defense, and academia, while outlining principles for accurate cartographic measurement.  \n\nThe map meticulously depicts coastlines, islands, mountain ranges, rivers, and administrative divisions. Roads between counties are marked with dots every 10 ri (4 km) for distance measurement. Within each county, key features such as military offices (yeong-a), county seats (eupchi), fortresses (seongji), garrisons (jinbo), warehouses (changgo), horse breeding grounds (mokso), beacon stations (bongsu), royal tombs (neungchim), villages (bangri), and historical sites (e.g., ancient counties, fortresses, and mountain fortresses) are labeled.  \n\nKim Jeong-ho dedicated his life to cartography and geography, producing seminal works like the Yeodo Bijiseung, Dongyeodo Ji, Daedong Jiji, Cheonggudo (1834), and the Daedongyeojido. Unlike earlier hand-copied maps, the Daedongyeojido was woodblock-printed, facilitating wider dissemination of geographical knowledge.

It is distinguished by its excellent woodblock printing, subtle hand-coloring (blue for rivers and lakes, red borders for counties and garrisons), and preservation state. Unlike most copies, which consist of 22 sections, this version uniquely binds the 21st (Jeju Island's Chuja Island) and 22nd (Jeju Island) sections together, resulting in 21 sections.

Commissioned to pray for the longevity of the crown prince and the protection of the Buddha, the stupa was built at Budongam Hermitage of Bonginsa Temple. Unlike typical stupas housing monastic remains, this one enshrines the Buddha’s sarira. The relics endured significant turmoil during the Japanese colonial period, being illegally exported to Japan in 1927 and only repatriated to Korea in 1987 after over six decades abroad.\n\nThe stupa features an octagonal plan with a three-tiered base (lower, middle, and upper) supporting a drum-shaped body stone that holds the sarira. An eight-sided roof stone crowns the structure, topped by an elongated finial. Its design evokes early Joseon-era stupas, such as those at Cheongnyongsa and Hoeamsa Temples, despite being constructed in the mid-Joseon period. Notable elements include dragon-head carvings at the roof’s eaves and a surrounding stone railing, reflecting continuity with earlier stylistic traditions.\n\nA square niche in the body stone yielded seven relics: three brass vessels, three silver vessels, and a crystal sarira bottle. The brass containers, each holding silk threads, silk, and incense, encase the silver vessels. The silver pieces are adorned with gilded cloud and dragon motifs on their lids and bear inscriptions on their bases, confirming their consecration in 1620 (Gwanghaegun’s 12th year).\n\nThis ensemble is significant as a mid-Joseon work that preserves early Joseon stylistic elements while introducing innovations, such as the elongated finial and the use of seven reliquaries—a departure from the era’s typical practice of using fewer. With a definitively dated creation, it serves as a critical reference for studying Joseon-era Buddhist art and material culture.",

When folded, the upper volume measures 42.3 cm (height) × 15.5 cm (width), while the middle and lower volumes are 49.3 cm × 15.5 cm. The dark blue covers feature silver floral patterns, with the title inscribed in gold on a red background. At the end of the text, a record lists 22 donors, including Choi Cheon-gyeong, who contributed to express gratitude to heaven, earth, parents, and the nation, and to pray for rebirth in the Pure Land after death. Unlike Goryeo-era sutras commissioned by royalty or aristocrats, this manuscript was produced through donations by commoners and low-born individuals, making it a critical resource for studying early Joseon Buddhist manuscript traditions.",

Known as the 'Mitachambeop' (Amitabha Repentance Ritual), it gained significant popularity in Korea since the Three Kingdoms period among devotees aspiring to rebirth in the Western Pure Land. The book is a woodblock-printed edition on hanji (Korean traditional paper), bound in two volumes: Volume 1–5 as one book and Volume 6–10 as another. It measures 37 cm in height and 24 cm in width, with a light-green cloth cover inscribed with the title 'Jeongto Mun' (Pure Land Text). The opening section depicts the Three Cosmic Buddhas (Past, Present, and Future) with their names, followed by the main text. A 1474 preface by Kim Su-on at the end lists prominent monks, royal relatives, and contributors involved in the carving and publication, highlighting its meticulous execution as a state-sponsored project by the Joseon royal court. Though not widely circulated due to its royal patronage, it was reprinted by Haeinsa Temple in 1503 and is now included in the Haeinsa Tripitaka Koreana (National Treasure). As a royal initiative, it represents the highest artistic and technical standards of early Joseon, with contributions from elite calligraphers, illustrators, and woodblock carvers.",

King Yeongjo implemented the Tangpyeong Policy to address severe factional strife, stabilized society by equitably appointing talented individuals, and fostered a cultural renaissance through his personal dedication to scholarship. This painting, depicting Yeongjo at the age of 51, was executed in colored pigments on silk, measuring 68 cm in width and 110 cm in height. The portrait portrays him facing to the right, wearing an ikseongwan (royal hat) and a red gonryongpo (dragon-embroidered robe) adorned with dragon motifs on the shoulders and chest. His face exhibits a reddish hue, with upturned eyes, a high nasal bridge, sharply defined nostrils, and straight lines at the corners of the mouth, rendered in a sculptural style. The geokdae (decorative belt) on his chest is elevated, and the absence of distinct outlines on the robe reflects the portraiture style of the late Joseon period. This portrait, created in 1900 by leading contemporary portrait artists, is a faithful copy of the original painting executed by Jang Gyeong-ju and Kim Du-ryang in the 20th year of Yeongjo’s reign (1744).

The mouth is slightly flared and attached to the middle of the body, while the oval-shaped foot is affixed to the opposite side, allowing the vessel to be stood upright on its side. The surface was coated with white slip applied using a brush, leaving visible brushmarks. Freehand peony vine patterns, rendered in underglaze iron-brown pigment with bold stylistic omissions, adorn one side, while a cross (十) is depicted on the rounded body. The thick slip layer and expressive brushwork exemplify the distinctive characteristics of Joseon Buncheong ware. This piece is a representative example of the 'gwiyal' technique, where slip is applied with a brush to create textured patterns, showcasing the genre's unique aesthetic through its spontaneous and daring design elements.",

Over this, black iron pigment was applied with fluid brushwork, skillfully blending light and dark tones for an elegant effect. The high, wide foot has Korean script inscribed on the inner base. Iron-painted white porcelain emerged in the late 15th century but remains rare from the 15th to 16th centuries. This bottle is a precious example from the late 16th century, distinguished by its unique string motif cascading from the neck—a hallmark of early Joseon ceramic artistry.",

Printed via woodblock on hanji (Korean traditional paper), the two-volume set is bound as a single book, though the first page of the upper volume and several final pages are missing. Its dimensions are 26.5 cm (height) × 16.5 cm (width). Notably, while most surviving copies of the Five Commentaries include explanatory notes (설의) by early Joseon monk Gi Hwa (己和), this version lacks them and instead appends a 'Resolution of Doubts' (결의) at the end, suggesting Gi Hwa’s commentary was composed later.",

One volume (Volumes 5–7) retains silk on its spine, suggesting it originally had a silk-covered binding (포배장).\n\nTranslated into Chinese by Kumārajīva (344–413 CE) of the Yaoqin dynasty, the Lotus Sutra is one of the most important early Mahayana scriptures. As the foundational text of the Tiantai (Cheontae) school, it was adopted as a core subject in Korean Buddhist seminaries and profoundly influenced the development of Korean Buddhist thought alongside the Avataṃsaka Sutra.\n\nThe Bomunsa Temple copy is identified as a later printed edition from the reign of King Seongjong (1470–1494), not the original print, based on wear patterns on the characters and guidelines.

The face is rendered with flesh tones outlined in brown, while the lips, painted in a slightly darker ochre, convey a subdued expression. The outer lines of the robe are angular, and the lining visible through the side slit of the garment appears stiffly starched. Though the subject differs, the portrait shares stylistic and formal similarities with those of Jang Mal-son and Son So, suggesting it was likely commissioned in 1476 (7th year of King Seongjong's reign) when portraits of all merit subjects were ordered.

Most surviving Goryeo Buddhist paintings focus on Amitabha, often illustrating scenes of him preaching in the Pure Land or welcoming devotees who practice chanting. Unlike typical depictions where Amitabha faces to the right, this figure is shown facing forward. Clad in a red kasaya (monastic robe) and green jangsam (outer robe), Amitabha stands with legs slightly apart, left hand placed near the chest and right hand lowered. A circular halo, rendered in gold powder, adorns the back of his head. The use of red and green robes alongside gold-patterned halos reflects characteristic features of Goryeo Buddhist art. Though lacking an inscription, the overall composition closely resembles a Goryeo-era Amitabha Buddha standing painting housed in Japan's Tōkai-an Temple, supporting its attribution to the Goryeo period. Notably, the right hand forms the middle mudra (thumb and middle finger touching), while the left hand exhibits no mudra—a unique inversion of hand gestures compared to other extant works, making this piece a rare example.",

A tankhwa refers to a Buddhist painting on fabric or paper, framed as a scroll or panel for hanging. During the mid-Joseon period, such paintings often combined Buddhist and Confucian themes of filial piety. This particular work features a landscape-style background and is divided into three tiers. The upper tier depicts an ideal Buddhist realm with the Three Buddha (Seokgamoni, Vairocana, and Nosana) and Seven Buddhas, a rare inclusion influenced by Huayan Buddhist thought. The middle tier shows a ritual table with monks performing ceremonies for starving pretas (hungry ghosts), demarcated by lightning and gold lines to signify sacred space. The lower tier illustrates the cycle of rebirth, including hell and the realm of pretas. The monks' robes, ritual instruments like drums and bells, and other details provide valuable insights into contemporary Buddhist practices. Created in 1681 (7th year of King Sukjong's reign), this painting is the second oldest extant Gamro Tankhwa after the 1649 version in the National Museum of Korea. Its landscape-style composition is characteristic of Joseon Buddhist art and serves as a critical resource for studying mid-to-late Joseon Gamro Tankhwa.",

      "content_en": "This is a relatively large white porcelain water dropper with eight sides. A water dropper (yeonjeok) is a vessel used to hold water for grinding ink on an inkstone. During the Goryeo period, such objects were primarily made of celadon, while in the Joseon period, white porcelain became the dominant material. The top of this water dropper features a three-dimensional depiction of clouds and dragons, intricately carved using various techniques to create a dynamic and lifelike expression. The eight sides are adorned with paintings of the 'Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang' (Sosangpalgyeong)—eight iconic landscapes where the Xiao and Xiang Rivers converge in China—rendered with skilled brushwork. While the specific themes of the landscapes are not explicitly detailed, the compositions are tightly structured and showcase notable artistic merit. On one side, where the water outlet is located, a poem replaces the painted scene. It identifies the theme as 'Autumn Moon over Dongting Lake' (Dongjeong Chuwol), one of the Eight Views, with two poetic lines flanking the central title. The use of cobalt-blue underglaze pigment for the designs suggests this piece was created in the 19th century, a period marked by experimentation in ceramic techniques. The vibrant dragon motif and painterly landscapes reflect the era's distinctive characteristics, making this object a valuable example of Joseon white porcelain craftsmanship.",

It is designed in an accordion-fold style (buncheop jeolcheop-sik), allowing it to be folded and unfolded like a screen. Comprising a total of 23 sections, the first section serves as an index, while sections 1 to 22 depict regional geography, mirroring the structure of the Daedongyeojido. The map delineates mountain ranges and rivers, with boundaries between states and counties (juhyeon) marked to indicate roads. Overlaid on this base are symbols for military camps (yeongjin), counties (juhyeon), fortresses (jinbo), postal routes (yeokdo), horse-breeding farms (mokso), wards (bangmyeon), warehouses (changgo), beacon stations (bongsu), royal tombs (neungchim), castles (seong), roads (doro), and guard posts (pasu). The scale is indicated on the first section with a grid, noting 'Bang Sipri Mae-pyeon' (each square represents ten ri, approximately 3.93 kilometers). Dongyeodo is regarded as the most beautifully and precisely crafted manuscript copy of the Daedongyeojido, rivaling the technical excellence of maps produced by the Royal Painting School (Dohwaseo). Its superb illustrations, calligraphy, and coloration exemplify the advanced cartographic techniques of late 18th-century Joseon, making it a representative masterpiece of the era.",

This bottle shares stylistic similarities with Northern Song Dynasty Cizhou kiln wares, particularly in its form and decorative motifs. The glaze, often oxidized during firing, typically exhibits a yellowish-brown hue, while the bold, thickly applied iron-painted designs convey a vibrant energy. The bottle features a flat, flared mouth, rounded shoulders, and a nearly straight body descending to the foot—a form considered an early, less-refined iteration of the Goryeo-style *maebyeong* (bottle), retaining characteristics of Chinese prototypes. The iron-painted motifs are applied thickly, creating raised, glossy black-brown patterns. A horizontal band divides the vessel into upper and lower registers: the narrower upper section bears a stylized chrysanthemum scroll, while the broader lower section depicts a large melon vine (절지문) intertwined with a bird, a pair of butterflies, and a bee. The glaze, though light yellowish, remains translucent and lacks crazing. The foot is trimmed on the interior, with traces of coarse sand used as a firing support. As a masterpiece of Goryeo iron-painted celadon, this piece is celebrated for its unconventional composition, dynamic brushwork, and harmonious contrast between the greenish-brown glaze and deep black-brown iron-painted designs.",

The composition employs a bird's-eye view to capture the vastness of the scene, with buildings rendered using diagonal parallel perspective slanting from the upper right to the lower left. To convey spatial depth, the sizes of mountain peaks and trees diminish gradually toward the upper part of the screen. However, the color palette does not emphasize atmospheric perspective, as distant peaks and structures remain sharply defined rather than blurred. The screen is densely populated with trees: pine trees line the ridges in the distant view, while mid- and foreground hills and villages feature vibrantly colored foliage of various species, a trend also observed in some 19th-century documentary paintings. Mountains are depicted with earthen ridges (tosan) using fine dots (mijeom) and swept-rock textures (amsan). The distant pine trees evoke the style of Lee Ui-yang (1768–?), leading to speculation that this screen may have been painted by artists associated with him.\n\nStarting from the right panel, the first panel shows Seodaemun Gate [Dunyimun] and the Guard Command Headquarters (Sumunjangcheong). The fourth panel features a gate inscribed with 'Giyoung' (圻營), denoting the provincial office. The central building in the sixth panel is Seonhwadang, the governor's office. The eighth panel includes Yeongeunmun Gate and Mohwagwan Hall, with a lotus pond spanning panels eight to nine. The tenth panel depicts Daeheon Peak, Soheon Peak, and Eupseongjeong Archery Ground. The final panel shows a shooting pavilion (Sajeong). Beyond these landmarks, the painting includes minor structures like latrines, warehouses, thatched and tiled houses, and shops such as herbal medicine stores, shoe shops, rice vendors, taverns, and market stalls. The vitality of the scene arises from dynamic daily life: processions, laborers, and interactions that blend landscape, cartography, and genre painting—a hallmark of 'seongsidoh' (cityscape) traditions.\n\nThe most prominent narrative is the procession of the Gyeonggi Governor, stretching from panels three to six. The mounted figure, presumed to be the governor, is distinctively detailed with facial features, emphasizing his status. Accompanied by a processional band, attendants, and spectators, the scene brims with realism. Elsewhere, scholars rest under pines, officers converse casually, grooms wait with horses, women carry water jars, a scholar rides with a page, a candy vendor sharpens scissors, laborers bear loads, farmers work fields, and women carry meal containers—all rendered with lively spontaneity.

It is part of an 81-volume compilation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, likely combining the 80-volume edition with the final volume of the 40-volume edition (Bohyeonhaengwonpum) or integrating three versions of the sutra. Volume 15 contains the latter half of the 12th section (Hyunsubum), where Manjushri Bodhisattva requests Hyunsu Bodhisattva to recite verses (gathas) describing the luminosity, meditative absorption (samadhi), and spiritual power (weishenli) attained through practice. The manuscript includes a colophon detailing its commission by Jeongjeokmandara (a high-ranking Yuan-Goryeo official titled Yeongnokdaebu and Huijeongsa), who dedicated the 81-volume Avatamsaka Sutra and 10-volume Shurangama Sutra to the well-being of his parents, the Yuan emperor, and the Goryeo king. Accompanied by intricate illustrated diagrams (byeonsangdo) and a colophon specifying its creation date, patron, and purpose, this artifact holds significant value for studying 14th-century art history, Buddhist culture, and diplomatic exchanges between Goryeo and Yuan.",

A white-text oval seal reading 'A Traveler Riding an Ox' (기우유자) appears on the left, alongside Kim's handwritten transcription of the full text of 'Autumn Sounds Fu,' dated to his 61st year.  \n\nThe composition portrays an autumn night scene: barren mountains under a moonlit sky, a Chinese-style thatched cottage (초옥) at the center, and Ouyang Xiu seated inside. A servant exits the cottage, gesturing toward the sound of wind rustling through trees, as described in the poem—'The stars and moon shine brightly, but there is no human sound; the noise comes from the trees' (星月皎潔, 明下在天, 四無人聲, 聲在樹間). Two cranes stretch their necks and open their beaks in response to the wind, while fallen leaves scatter in the courtyard.

The title 'Left-Captaining Merit Subject' (Jwamyung Gongsin) was granted to those who contributed to suppressing the Second Strife of Princes during the early Joseon period.

Following the precedent of designating Taizo Gaeguk Gongsin (太祖開國功臣, Founding Merit Subjects) during King Taejo's reign, Taejong selected 47 individuals who supported him, categorizing them into four ranks as Left-Captaining Merit Subjects. Ma Cheon-mok received this certificate as a third-rank merit subject. This document is the only extant copy among the 47 certificates issued to Left-Captaining Merit Subjects.
