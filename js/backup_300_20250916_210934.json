It consists of a body for burning incense and a lid sculpted in the form of a kneeling kirin, a mythical creature. The body flares outward at the top and is supported by three animal-shaped legs. Cloud patterns adorn the body and its rim, with the lid placed atop. The center of the lid features a kirin turning its head backward, its seat engraved with lightning patterns. The kirin's horn is broken, its mane rendered in curly details, and its eyes accented with black pigment dots. Structurally, incense smoke is designed to escape through the open mouth of the kirin. The burner is enveloped in a subtle, jade-green glaze characteristic of the period, exuding elegance. During the 12th century, when celadon glazes reached their zenith, such symbolic animal- and plant-shaped celadons were widely produced.",

Measuring 42.1 cm in height with a mouth diameter of 6.2 cm and base diameter of 17 cm, the vase features a small, low, slightly flared rim and broad, imposing shoulders. A floral band encircles the area below the rim, while a lotus pattern adorns the base. The central body displays intricate inlaid cloud and crane motifs: within black-and-white inlaid circular compartments, cranes ascend amid clouds, while outside these circles, cranes descend toward the lower section. This dynamic arrangement—alternating upward and downward crane movements—creates an illusion of spatial freedom beyond the vessel's physical constraints, reflecting Goryeo artisans' innovative approach to composition. The technical mastery and creative expression evident in the design underscore the sophistication and artistic ingenuity of Goryeo celadon craftsmanship.",

It comprises a body for burning incense and a lid shaped like a crouching lion. The body is supported by three animal-shaped legs adorned with finely carved cloud patterns on its surface, with additional cloud motifs arranged at three points along the upper rim. The lid depicts a lion seated on a pedestal decorated with floral patterns. The lion's posture, slightly shifted to the left, creates a dynamic visual effect. It is shown with its mouth open, one knee bent, and eyes rendered with black dots to represent pupils. Swirling patterns mimic the lion's mane at the back of its neck and hips, while its tail is raised and pressed against its back. The glaze exhibits a pale greenish-blue hue with a subtle, lustrous sheen. Structurally, the incense smoke from the body is designed to escape through the lion's open mouth, showcasing the refined craftsmanship of celadon incense burners from this period. During the early 12th century, when jade-green celadon reached its zenith, many symbolic celadon works modeled after auspicious animals and plants were produced. Notably, lion-shaped incense burners were particularly acclaimed by Song dynasty scholars for their exceptional artistry.",

Originally located on Bongdae Peak in Bukhansan, it was relocated to Gyeongbokgung Palace for preservation and is now housed in the National Museum of Korea. The stele is made of a rectangularly carved stone, erected on a two-tiered platform atop a natural rock base. The upper portion is partially missing, with the remaining body measuring 1.54 meters in height and 69 cm in width. The inscription consists of 12 lines, each containing 32 characters in regular script (haeseo), detailing the king's purpose for visiting the region and the reasons for erecting the stele. The text predominantly praises King Jinheung's territorial expansions. Although the exact date of construction remains uncertain due to eroded inscriptions, it is estimated to have been erected between 561 (the year of the Changnyeong Stele) and 568 (the year of the Hwangchoryeong Stele) during King Jinheung's reign. The stele was discovered and deciphered by scholar Kim Jeong-hui (Jeong-hee) in 1816, during the Joseon Dynasty, and remains a critical historical resource for studying the Three Kingdoms period.",

The body features raised scales and large pectoral fins carved in relief at the center. The handle, modeled after a lotus stem, curves naturally over the body, while the lid replicates a fish's tail fin. The jade-green glaze harmonizes with intricate incised patterns on the fins and floral motifs, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship.

Originally used in Buddhist rituals to symbolically cleanse evil, the water bottle was a vessel introduced to Korea via China from Western styles, but reached its most refined form during the Goryeo period. This masterpiece stands out among such artifacts with its serene jade-green glaze of a pale greenish-blue hue, adorned solely with white slip inlay depicting willows, reeds, lotus blossoms, and a pair of mandarin ducks arranged in a pictorial composition. The neck features a peony flower inlaid on each side. The spout, designed in an octagonal shape, is elegantly crafted and stands vertically atop the neck. The pouring mouth, round and modestly attached to one side of the shoulder, originally had a lid that is now lost. Early inlaid celadon pieces from this period are characterized by their meticulously refined glaze and clay body, with the jade-green glaze enhancing their sophistication. The addition of inlaid patterns further elevated their decorative appeal. This water bottle exemplifies the highly refined and elegant style of early Goryeo inlaid celadon craftsmanship.",

Published in 1448 (30th year of Sejong's reign), it comprises six volumes and six books in metal type. Contrasted with the Chinese rhyme book Hongmu Zhengyun, 'Dongguk Jeongun' means 'Correct Sounds of the Eastern Kingdom,' reflecting its purpose to unify and standardize chaotic Hanja pronunciations in Korea. Completed in September 1447, it was distributed to institutions like Sungkyunkwan by November 1448. Only Volumes 1 and 6 survive today. The main text uses woodblock characters, while smaller text and preface employ Gabinja type; the large characters are based on the handwriting of Grand Prince Jinyang. This work holds immense significance as Korea's first systematic documentation of Hanja pronunciation in its own phonetic system, rivaling Hunminjeongeum in linguistic value.

It serves as a crucial resource for studying both the stylistic characteristics of the enshrined Buddha and the architectural trends of the period. This particular shrine, standing 18cm tall, is crafted from bronze with a gilded surface. Inside, a square base surrounded by a railing supports the main Buddha triad—comprising the principal Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas—covered by a roofed structure resembling a Buddhist hall. The hall-shaped lid features large windows on the front and sides, allowing clear visibility of the enshrined statues. The principal Buddha has an abstract facial expression, with robes draped over both shoulders rendered in simplified linear folds. The mandorla (light halo) behind the Buddha is divided into a head halo and a body halo, adorned with flame patterns along the edges. The bodhisattvas on either side, except for their beaded crowns, share similar stylistic and technical features with the principal Buddha. The shrine remains in excellent condition, with its golden luster still vibrant and traces of green patina on the roof. Based on stylistic elements such as the elongated torso of the principal Buddha, irregular robe folds, and the beaded crowns of the bodhisattvas, it is estimated to have been created in the 11th–12th century under the influence of Northern Chinese traditions. This artifact holds significant value as a rare example illustrating wooden architectural styles and sculptural techniques from the Goryeo period or earlier.",

      "content_en": "This statue depicts a bodhisattva seated on a throne with the right leg crossed over the left, the right elbow resting on the knee, and the fingers of the right hand touching the cheek. Standing 80 cm tall, it was acquired by a Japanese individual in 1912 and donated to the Japanese Government-General of Korea. It was transferred to the Government-General Museum in 1916 and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The bodhisattva wears an elaborate crown with two strands of ornamentation cascading down to the shoulders. The square-shaped face, with prominent cheekbones and a recessed mouth, exudes a plump, serene smile. The upper body is robust and erect, while the lower body exhibits graceful curves. The hands and feet are disproportionately large compared to the slender limbs and physique. The overall form is elastic, smooth, and rhythmic, enhancing the statue's elegant aura. The celestial garment drapes over the shoulders, flares upward like bird feathers, flows down the chest, crosses at the left leg, wraps around the knees and arms. The skirt, slightly thick, features skillfully carved U-shaped folds. The elliptical lotus pedestal beneath the left foot is engraved with lotus patterns, though the halo at the back of the head is missing. Radiographic analysis in 1963 revealed no internal defects or repairs, with the material and craftsmanship noted as highly unusual. The balanced posture, beautiful drapery, and enigmatic meditative expression suggest it is a masterpiece of Korean Buddhist art, likely created in the mid-6th century or shortly thereafter.",

The robe drapes both shoulders, featuring a V-shaped fold at the front and feather-like trailing edges on either side. The right hand is raised with palm facing forward and fingers pointing upward, while the left hand, also palm-forward, has two fingers bent downward—a distinctive gesture.

Their robes cross in an X-pattern at the front, and their hand gestures differ from the principal Buddha. The halo, adorned with flame patterns in fine lines, has a pointed boat shape. Around the principal Buddha, the halo is divided into a circular head halo and rectangular body halo, intricately carved with lotus, vine, and grapevine motifs. The pedestal, a flared cylindrical base, is engraved with lotus designs. Stylistically similar to the National Treasure Gilt-bronze Sinmyo Buddha Triad, this statue follows the iconography of the Northern and Southern Dynasties of China.

Despite the dynasty's policy of promoting Confucianism and suppressing Buddhism, it remained a protected important temple until 1504, when King Yeonsan converted it into a brothel named Yeonbangwon (聯芳院), expelling the monks and leading to the temple's demise. This pagoda is the only one of its kind from the Joseon period, standing approximately 12 meters tall.

The pagoda's body comprises ten stories: the first three tiers retain the 'Asia' shape, while the upper seven form a square plan. Each story meticulously replicates wooden architectural elements, including roofs, bracketing systems (hyungja), and pillars. Unlike most Korean stone pagodas made of granite, this marble structure closely resembles the 10-story stone pagoda of Gyeongcheonsa Temple from the Goryeo period, drawing significant attention.

Both figures are mounted on short-legged horses atop thick rectangular bases. The horse's hindquarters feature a lamp with a hole, and a protruding spout on the chest allows water to be poured through the hollow body. The master figure wears a triangular hat adorned with a band and decorations, along with lattice-patterned trousers, reflecting elaborate horse trappings. The servant figure has a topknot wrapped in a headband, a bare upper body, a burden on its back, and holds a bell-like object in the right hand, suggesting a role as a guide. These ceramics provide critical insights into Silla-era spiritual beliefs, clothing, weaponry, horse gear, and artistic design.",

      "content_en": "This Buddhist statue, discovered in 1930 in Bongsan-ri, Hwacheon-myeon, Goksan-gun, Hwanghae-do, is currently housed at the Leeum Museum of Art. Standing 15.5 cm tall, it is a triad (three-bodied Buddha) carved on a single large halo (광배), with the central Buddha flanked by smaller bodhisattvas on either side. It is the largest extant statue of this format. The flanking bodhisattvas are significantly smaller, appearing almost dangling at the edges of the halo, which accentuates the prominence of the central Buddha. Apart from minor scratches on the Buddha's chest and the halo's right edge, the overall preservation is excellent.\n\nThe central Buddha has a plump face with a subtle smile, a large usnisa (육계, topknot), and thick robes covering the shoulders and extending to the ankles. The right hand is raised with the palm facing outward, while the left hand is lowered, palm downward. The halo, detachable from the statue, is fixed via a protruding spike on the back of the Buddha. Shaped like a boat (배 모양), the halo features a head halo and body halo around the Buddha, adorned with lotus, vine, and morning glory patterns. Flame motifs frame the edges, with small Buddha figures between the sections. The two attendant bodhisattvas at the halo's base have large faces and slender, cylindrical bodies, with X-shaped robe patterns on their chests. Their craftsmanship appears less refined compared to the central Buddha.\n\nAn inscription on the halo's reverse records that five individuals commissioned the statue to honor their teacher and parents. Stylistic and epigraphic analysis suggests it is a Goguryeo work, with the inscribed year 'Sinmyo' (辛卯) corresponding to 571 CE (13th year of King Pyeongwon's reign). While the statue's overall form—characterized by a large face, abstract body, and hand gestures—follows the style of the National Treasure Gilt-Bronze Standing Buddha from Yeonga 7th Year, it exhibits a softer, more refined aesthetic compared to the earlier piece's robust vigor.",

      "content_en": "This 20.7 cm tall gilt-bronze statue of a standing bodhisattva was discovered in 1967 in Samyang-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul, and is currently housed in the National Museum of Korea. The statue exhibits a crack above the ankle and a partially detached left robe. The bodhisattva wears a triangular crown adorned with a small Buddha image and has a rounded, serene face with a faint smile. The narrow shoulders and protruding abdomen create a curved silhouette reminiscent of a bow when viewed from the side. Thick robes draped in a U-shape around the waist and knees obscure the leg contours, with simplified linear folds. The right hand holds a flask (vase), while the left hand extends upward with the thumb and index finger forming a straight V-shape—a distinctive gesture. The lotus pedestal features inverted petals with sharp tips, contrasting the statue's softness. Identified as Avalokiteshvara due to the triangular crown with a Buddha image and the flask, the statue's plump facial features, body proportions, and U-shaped drapery suggest a creation date in the early 7th century. It serves as a critical artifact illustrating the prevalence of Avalokiteshvara veneration during the late Three Kingdoms period.",

The square-like face lacks a smile, imparting a solemn expression. The thin robe clings closely to the body, subtly revealing bodily contours, though the garment's folds are not sharply defined. Bead decorations descending from the shoulders cross in an X-shape near the abdomen and extend down the legs, with a round floral medallion at the center—a motif influenced by ancient Chinese styles also seen in Three Kingdoms period gilt-bronze Buddhist statues. The right hand holds the robe's hem, while the left clasps a large water pot (jingbi), identifying the figure as Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. The hexagonal pedestal features an inverted lotus pattern at the base and an open lotus motif above, with broad, softly carved petals distinctive of Baekje craftsmanship. Despite extensive oxidation, the statue retains a vibrant golden hue and embodies the graceful elegance characteristic of Baekje Buddhist sculptures.",

Currently, the pedestal (daeza) on which the Bodhisattva once stood and the crown (gwan) it wore are missing, and the left hand has broken off at the forearm. The head appears slightly large in proportion to the body, with a prominent usnisa (topknot) atop the head. The face gives an impression of stiffness, as the area below the eyes is notably elongated compared to the upper part. The celestial garment (cheoni) diagonally crosses the broad chest, flows down the back, and drapes over both arms, with the right hand holding one of its strands. The skirt, folded once at the waist, cascades over the knees and extends to the ankles. The U-shaped, raised wrinkles on the skirt are rendered with sophisticated and elegant craftsmanship. While similar Bodhisattva statues from the Unified Silla period are commonly found, this piece shares typological affinities with works such as the Gyeongju Gamsansa Stone Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), created in 719 (18th year of King Seongdeok's reign), and the Gyeongju Gulbulsa Temple Stone Quadruple Buddha (Treasure), dated to the mid-8th century, despite differences in material.

The head halo contains lotus motifs, while intricate flame patterns adorn the outer edges of both sections. The pedestal beneath the figures bears double-lined lotus designs, a style reminiscent of Baekje-period works such as the Jeongjiwon-inscribed Gilt-bronze Standing Shakyamuni Buddha (Treasure) from Busosan Mountain and the Gilt-bronze Seated Maitreya Bodhisattva (National Treasure), though executed with greater refinement. The 'X'-shaped drapery, wing-like robe folds, and bent finger gesture reflect typical Three Kingdoms period iconography.

The main body (tapsin) alternates between door motifs and vividly sculpted Four Heavenly Kings, while the roof stone meticulously replicates wooden architecture with tile grooves, eave ends, and rafter patterns. Though the original finial is lost, a gold-plated bronze inscription (geumdong tapji) discovered during relocation confirmed its construction date to 844.  \n\nAs the oldest extant relic stupa in Korea, this masterpiece exemplifies refined elegance and craftsmanship, setting a precedent for subsequent stupa designs. Its historical and artistic significance lies in preserving the transition from abstract to representational Buddhist sculpture and its role in establishing Seon Buddhism's legacy.\"\n}",

Originating from King Jeongjo's personal diary, the Johnheongak Ilgi, which he began as a crown prince to reflect on his actions and studies—inspired by the Confucian Analects' teaching of daily self-examination—the records evolved into an official state diary.

      "content_en": "This is a Buncheong flat-sided bottle from the early Joseon period, measuring 22.5 cm in height, 5.2 cm in mouth diameter, and 8.6 cm in base diameter. The body is rounded with flattened sides and a small mouth. It features a grayish-brown clay body coated with white slip and a thick transparent light brown glaze. The shoulder below the mouth is adorned with a band of stylized lotus motifs, while the front flattened surface is decorated with lotus leaves, blossoms, and fish patterns. The sides display lotus motifs on the upper and middle sections, and a double lotus band at the lower part. The piece primarily employs the pajiki technique (scraping away slip to reveal the clay beneath), with additional harmonious line work for detailing. The striking contrast between the white slip and grayish-brown clay highlights the craftsmanship. Notably, the naturalistic depiction of lotus leaves and fish amidst multiple lotus buds on the front exemplifies the characteristic use of the pajiki technique, making it a representative work of this method.",

This work, *Sehando* (Winter Journey), measures 69.2 cm in width and 23 cm in height, and is considered his masterpiece. Painted in 1844 during his exile on Jeju Island, the artwork includes a personal inscription by Kim.

Above the right side, the title *Sehando* is accompanied by the phrases 'U-si-seong' (A Scholar’s Winter Thoughts) and 'Wandang' (Kim’s pen name), along with his seal.

Its unique form, unseen in traditional Korean pagodas, traces its origins to the Chinese Wu-Yue Kingdom. The last ruler of Wu-Yue, King Chongui (Chun Hongxu), was inspired by the legend of Indian Emperor Ashoka, who divided the Buddha's sacred relics into 84,000 stupas. Following this tradition, Chun Hongxu crafted 84,000 miniature pagodas from gold, bronze, and iron, each containing a copy of the 'Bohyeobin Dharani Sutra.' The only surviving stone version of such a pagoda in Korea is preserved at Dongguk University Museum. Originally found collapsed in a valley near Daepyeong-ri, Buk-myeon, Cheonan, the pagoda was relocated to its current site. The temple site, dated to the Goryeo period based on remaining stone foundations, pillar bases, and roof tiles, lacks historical records. The restored pagoda, incomplete with only five remaining stones, deviates from conventional Korean tower designs. It features two stacked square box-shaped stones topped with a decorative finial, a hexagonal base carved with Buddha images, a square platform, and another hexagonal tier engraved with four scenes from the Buddha's past lives. A circular sarira hole at the center of the top tier once held the sutra. The uppermost stone, resembling donkey ears, depicts episodes from the Buddha's life. Influenced by Chinese Bohyeobin pagodas, this Goryeo-era structure is a rare and invaluable artifact. In 2018, structural reinforcements were implemented using titanium plates to replace coin spacers, and a new base stone was added to enhance stability, based on humanities research and 3D scanning.",

Typically, Amitabha Triad paintings feature Avalokiteshvara and Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva as attendants, but this work uniquely substitutes Mahasthamaprapta with Ksitigarbha. Amitabha Buddha gazes downward at a person reborn in the Pure Land, radiating light. Ksitigarbha, positioned to the right, holds a bead in his right hand. Avalokiteshvara, standing before Amitabha with a slightly bent waist, holds a lotus pedestal on his palm.

Dated to the late Goryeo period, this work exhibits distinctive features, including the substitution of Ksitigarbha for Mahasthamaprapta, the placement of Avalokiteshvara in front of Amitabha, and the emphasis on illuminating the reborn soul.

It measures 29.2 cm in height, with a mouth diameter of 10.7 cm and a base diameter of 14 cm. The mouth flares outward, the shoulder swells before gradually narrowing downward, and the lid features a prominent lotus bud-shaped knob. The decoration includes faint underglaze blue patterns: a band of small, dense lotus motifs encircles the knob and its surroundings, with seven large dots placed around it. Horizontal lines with dots between them are drawn on the lid's sides. Simplified lotus bands adorn the shoulder and lower body of the jar. The central design depicts a plum tree trunk and bamboo branches rendered with nuanced shading. A distinctive feature is the bold simplification of patterns, emphasizing negative space to highlight the main motifs. Based on its form and decoration, it is presumed to have been produced at a state-managed kiln (gwanyo).",

Most known gilt-bronze towers measure 20–30 cm in height, with those exceeding 50 cm being exceptionally rare. However, this tower stands at 155 cm in its current state, indicating a notably large scale. Although only five stories of the tower body remain, it is believed to have originally comprised seven stories, with the loss of part of its finial suggesting it was even taller in antiquity.\n\nThe tower follows the general form of stone pagodas, featuring a two-tiered base, a five-story tower body, and a finial at the apex. The base is adorned with pillar motifs reminiscent of wooden architecture on its corners and surfaces. The lower tier’s surfaces bear lotus petals encircled by rounded bands, a characteristic feature of Goryeo-period stone pagoda styles.\n\nA railing encircles the base, supporting the tower body. The first story includes an entrance, pillars, and a roof, faithfully replicating wooden architectural techniques. While the second to fifth stories are carved with Buddhist images, the craftsmanship is relatively unrefined. Wind bells (풍탁) once hung from each roof corner, though many have been lost, leaving only a few remaining.\n\nDespite the near-complete loss of its original gold plating, the tower is exceptionally well-preserved. Its expansive base contrasts with the tower body’s light, soaring appearance. The profuse decorative elements and numerous ornaments underscore its nature as a craft pagoda, while its adherence to wooden architectural forms is evident throughout. Given its large scale, meticulous detailing, and metallurgical techniques, it is speculated to have been crafted in the early Goryeo period.",

Another identical painting exists, distinguished by its colored pigments and black-inked labels identifying buildings. Based on the presence and reconstruction dates of depicted structures, it is estimated to have been created by Dohwaseo (Royal Painting Academy) artists before 1830 (30th year of King Sunjo's reign). These paintings hold greater historical value for architectural research than artistic merit, offering a visually superior representation of palace layouts and landscapes compared to flat maps or the Donggwoldo diagrams.

The Mahayana Abhidharma-Samuchchaya is a text that compiles and elucidates the wisdom necessary for attaining Buddhahood. This volume, translated by Xuanzang during the Tang Dynasty, is part of the First Tripitaka Koreana created during the reign of King Hyeonjong of Goryeo (r. 1011–1031). Comprising 27 leaves, it was printed on thick, durable paper from woodblocks and designed to be unfolded like a folding screen. When folded, it measures 31 cm in height and 12.2 cm in width. In the Tripitaka catalog, which organizes texts according to the Cheonjagam (Thousand Character Classic) sequence, this volume is stored in the 'Bo' (寶) case. Leaf numbering uses the character 'jang' (丈) for leaves 1 to 26, with the final leaf marked as 'jang' (張), reflecting the common practice in the First Tripitaka. A distinctive feature is the omission of the final stroke in the 'gyeong' (竟) character at the end of the text, a hallmark of early Goryeo Tripitaka editions. The paper quality, carving technique, and ink tone confirm its 11th-century origin, and it remains in relatively good condition.",

A leading Neo-Confucianist and successor to the academic lineage of Yulgok Yi I, Song dedicated his life to studying Zhu Xi’s philosophy and was central to the Giho School. Renowned for his logical prose and calligraphy, his intellectual legacy remains influential.\n\nThe portrait, measuring 89.7 cm in height and 67.6 cm in width, is a half-length depiction on silk with polychrome pigments. Song is depicted wearing a black geon (hat) and a changui (scholar’s everyday robe), gazing to the right. His robust physique, exaggerated in scale, combined with distinctive eyebrows and deep wrinkles around the cheekbones, conveys a sense of scholarly depth. The face is lightly tinted with brown lines delineating wrinkles, while the robe’s folds are rendered with soft, simplified curves.\n\nInscriptions on the upper right include a 1651 self-commentary by Song in regular script (haeseo), and above center, a 1707 poem by King Sukjong honoring Jeong Mong-ju in clerical script (yeseo), accompanied by the notation 'Jeongmyo Year' (1707). However, uncertainties about the timing of these inscriptions complicate dating the artwork. While stylistic elements like simplified drapery and lack of shading suggest a 17th-century origin, some scholars argue it is an 18th-century copy, given the later inscription.\n\nAfter Song’s death, numerous shrines and academies were established nationwide to venerate him, leading to the production of many copies of his portrait. This version, regarded as one of the finest, epitomizes the aesthetic and symbolic traits of Joseon scholar portraits, reflecting both individuality and Confucian ideals.",

Each bell measures 14.4 cm and 14.3 cm in diameter, with the small bells (2.4 cm in diameter) featuring four oval holes. The main body has 2–3 lines of dotted patterns and a large '十' (sun symbol) motif.

The convex middle tapers toward the ends, which have bells with four oval holes and bronze beads inside. One bell has an additional small hole in the center.\n\n3. **Combined Ssangduryeong**: An X-shaped bell (17.3 cm long, 4.4 cm bell diameter, 628 g) formed by interlocking two bodies. One end has an insertion hole, while the other has a knob to secure the connection.\n\n4. **Ganduryeong (Cannonball-Shaped Bells)**: A pair (14.7 cm and 14.9 cm tall, 616.5 g and 571 g) divided into a body and handle with a brim. Hollow compartments hold bronze beads in the upper section, while the lower section is empty to amplify sound.

      "content_en": "The Great Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, often abbreviated as the 'Great Prajñā Sūtra' or 'Prajñā Sūtra,' is a foundational Mahayana Buddhist text centered on the concept of śūnyatā (emptiness), teaching that all phenomena lack inherent existence and thus should not be clung to. In Korea, it is widely known as the 'Heart Sutra' and is universally recited across Buddhist sects. This particular set comprises Volumes 162, 170, and 463 of the First Tripitaka Koreana, carved during the Goryeo Dynasty under King Hyeonjong (r. 1011–1031) to invoke Buddhist protection against Khitan invasions. Translated into Chinese by the Tang dynasty scholar Xuanzang, these volumes were printed on mulberry paper using woodblocks and designed as scrolls. Volume 162’s colophon reveals it was commissioned in 1046 by Heo Jinsu to pray for the king’s peace, his mother’s longevity, and his deceased father’s spiritual welfare. Distinct from the later Haeinsa Tripitaka Koreana (Second Tripitaka), the First Edition exhibits differences such as varying character counts (25 lines × 14 characters per line vs. 23 × 14), absence of publication dates, use of pi-hui (avoidance of imperial names) and abbreviated characters, and the use of '장(丈)' or '폭(幅)' instead of '장(張)' for page numbering. These three volumes, preserved in similar condition, are critical for dating other First Tripitaka prints due to Volume 162’s explicit historical record.",

      "content_en": "This set of four white porcelain bowls was created in the early Joseon period. Each bowl measures approximately 11.1 cm in height, 21.1 cm in rim diameter, and 7.9 cm in base diameter. The rims exhibit a bold, outward-flaring form. The pieces are devoid of decorative patterns, with a well-melted glaze that imparts a bright white hue. Inside the base of each bowl, the glaze was scratched to inscribe the characters 'Cheon' (天), 'Ji' (地), 'Hyeon' (玄), and 'Hwang' (黃). These inscriptions are believed to correspond to the names of royal storage houses—Cheonjago, Jijago, Hyeonjago, and Hwangjago—located near Geunjeongjeon Hall in Gyeongbokgung Palace, where royal tableware was stored and categorized. The refined clay, evenly applied glaze, pure white color, neat footring, and fine sand supports suggest these were high-quality wares produced at state-operated kilns in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, for royal use. As early Joseon white porcelain, this set serves as critical material for tracing the historical lineage of Korean white porcelain craftsmanship.",

The front and back panels depict chrysanthemums and orchids rendered in raised relief, accompanied by bees and butterflies. The orchids are in cobalt blue, chrysanthemums in copper-red, stems and leaves in iron-black, and insects in iron-black or copper-red.

Additionally, land and official positions were bestowed upon their parents, spouses, and descendants. These details, absent from the Joseon Annals, were revealed through this document. The text employs Idumun (吏讀文), a mix of Chinese characters and Korean phonetic elements, making it a valuable historical and linguistic resource. Printed using woodtype (목활자), it is one of the most complete early Joseon woodblock-printed documents surviving in South Korea. Its rolled format reflects early Joseon characteristics, though the uneven letter sizing and irregular arrangement indicate less refined printing techniques. As a rare extant example of early Korean woodtype printing, it holds significant importance in the history of Korean typography.",

It synthesizes medical knowledge from Joseon and Chinese sources with clinical experiences. Although King Seonjo initially commissioned its compilation in 1596 with Heo Jun, Yang Yesu (楊禮壽), and Lee Myeong-won (李命源), the project was halted by war. Heo Jun independently completed it after 14 years of dedication. The Dongui Bogam is widely acclaimed as the most outstanding medical work authored by Koreans, both domestically and internationally. The first edition, printed in 1613 using wooden movable type by the Royal Secretariat (Nauiwon), consists of 25 volumes and 25 books.\n\nThe text is organized into five main sections: a 2-volume table of contents, the Naegyeong Pyeon (內景篇, Internal Medicine) with 4 volumes and 26 subsections, the Oehyeong Pyeon (外形篇, External Medicine) with 4 volumes and 26 subsections, the Japbyeong Pyeon (雜病篇, Miscellaneous Diseases) with 11 volumes and 38 subsections, the Tangyeok Pyeon (湯液篇, Decoctions and Medicinals) with 3 volumes and 17 subsections, and the Chimgu Pyeon (鍼灸篇, Acupuncture and Moxibustion) with 1 volume and 1 subsection. Each section systematically categorizes diseases, detailing theories, prescriptions, and source references.\n\nThe Dongui Bogam was widely disseminated beyond Joseon, influencing medical practices in China and Japan. In China, it was published multiple times starting in 1763 (Qianlong 28), while in Japan, the first edition appeared in 1724 (Kyoto Shorin) and was reprinted in 1799 (Osaka Shorin), solidifying its status as a essential text in East Asian medicine.\n\nThe Kyujanggak Institute of Seoul National University houses two copies. The Taebaeksan Sagobon (太白山史庫本), a 24-volume set, lacks Volume 16 of the Japbyeong Pyeon. However, a separate 17-volume set from the same woodblock edition includes the missing volume, complementing the Taebaeksan copy. Designated in 2008, the Dongui Bogam’s historical significance as the first edition and its completeness—achieved through the supplementary volume—were pivotal in its recognition as a national treasure.",

The site is believed to have been a temple from the Three Kingdoms period, as evidenced by numerous roof tile and pottery fragments found in the area.\n\nThe Bodhisattva stands gracefully on a lotus-adorned pedestal, with a slightly bent right knee, exuding natural elegance. The crown, decorated with floral motifs, features a small Buddha image at its center. The rounded face, with distinct eyes, nose, and mouth, bears a serene smile.\n\nThe slender, well-proportioned body is clad in thin, clinging robes. The garment drapes over the right arm, forming a circular fold at the knee before cascading over the left arm to the pedestal. A necklace with bead decorations extends from the shoulders in an X-pattern, mirrored on the statue's back. The right hand gently holds a lotus bud, while the left hand, though missing its original object, suggests it once grasped an offering. The seven-sided pedestal is engraved with downward-facing lotus petals.\n\nCurrently, parts of the crown, robe drapes, and left hand fingers are damaged, and the halo is lost. Rust is present on the face and right hand, but the gilding remains relatively intact. This statue exemplifies the typical style of mid-7th century Silla gilt-bronze Bodhisattva sculptures, showcasing exceptional balance and craftsmanship.",

Its overall shape closely resembles the modern outline of the Korean Peninsula, extending northward to Manchuria and southward to Jeju Island and Tsushima Island, reflecting Joseon's territorial consciousness during the period. Dated to approximately 1557–1558 (12th–13th years of King Myeongjong's reign), the map was taken to Japan during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and preserved in Tsushima before being acquired in the 1930s.

Originally named 'Seoru' (West Pavilion), it was renamed 'Jukseoru' (Bamboo-West Pavilion) in the late 14th century. Historical records, including Kim Su-on's *Jukseoru Dancheonggi* (1472) and Heo Mok's *Jukseoru Gi* (1662), indicate that Governor Kim Hyo-son (1373–1429) rebuilt the pavilion on its original site in 1403. Although it underwent multiple repairs and expansions after its reconstruction in the early Joseon period, its original form from the late Joseon era has been well preserved. The name 'Jukseoru' is derived from its location west of Jukjangsa Temple, as noted by Heo Mok.\n\nThe pavilion was initially a five-kan (front) by two-kan (side) structure rebuilt in 1403. It was expanded to three-kan on the south side in 1530 and two-kan on the north side in 1788, resulting in its current hipped-and-gabled (paljak) roof form. The central five-kan section from the early Joseon period and the later additions on the left and right exhibit distinct architectural features in column arrangements, structural framing, ceiling treatments, bracket systems, and decorative details.\n\nThirteen of the 22 pillars stand directly on natural bedrock, while nine are supported by stone foundations. The southern expansion retains exposed natural rock flooring, with only the central kan paved for accessibility. The interior features an open layout without walls or partitions, with exposed rafters (yeondeung ceiling) and grid-patterned (ungmul) ceilings. The floor is constructed with a grid-style wooden plank (ungmul maru) system, flanked by railings to prevent falls.\n\nThe pavilion once housed numerous plaques inscribed with poems by King Sukjong, King Jeongjo, and prominent literati, though many were lost during the 1959 Typhoon Sarah. Twenty-eight plaques remain, including the 1710 inscriptions 'Jukseoru' and 'Gwandong Jeilru' (First Pavilion of Gwandong) by Governor Lee Seong-jo. Literary works such as Jeong Cheol's *Gwandong Byeolgok* and paintings by Jeong Seon (*Gwandong Myeongseungcheop*, 1676–1759), Kim Hong-do (1745–1806+), and Kang Se-hwang (1713–1791) further attest to its cultural significance.\n\nSamcheok Jukseoru holds immense historical value due to well-documented construction and expansion dates, architectural evolution across eras, and its association with literary and artistic legacies.

The pagoda follows the typical Unified Silla style, featuring a three-tiered body atop a two-tiered base. The lower base is adorned with celestial beings (天人像) in flowing garments, while the upper base depicts the Eight Legions of Divine Beings (八部神衆) seated on clouds, brandishing weapons in a majestic posture. Each tier's body and roof stones are carved from single blocks, with the first-tier body stone featuring various Buddhist images. The roof stones have slightly uplifted eaves at the corners, enhancing their graceful beauty, and are supported by five-tiered bases. Only the finial base remains atop the third-tier roof stone, as the original ornamental elements have been lost. Balanced in composition, this pagoda is one of the representative stone pagodas of the Unified Silla period. The exquisite carvings on the base and the sophisticated Buddhist images on the first-tier body stone evoke the former splendor of Jinjeonsa Temple.",

The Palsangjeon Hall is the only remaining five-story wooden pagoda in Korea. The current structure was rebuilt after the Imjin War (1592-1598) and underwent dismantling and restoration in 1968. Its name derives from the 'Eight Scenes of the Buddha's Life' (Pal Sang-do), which are painted on the walls, depicting eight key moments from the Buddha's life.\n\nThe architectural design varies by floor: the first and second floors have five bays (front and side), the third and fourth have three bays, and the fifth has two bays. Stone staircases on all four sides and a low foundation contribute to its stability despite its height. The roof features a pyramidal (samo) style with a finial atop. Structurally, the first to fourth floors use the jusimpo bracket system (supports placed only above columns), while the fifth floor employs the dapo bracket system (supports between columns as well).\n\nInternally, the hall houses a space for enshrining sarira relics, Buddha statues, the Eight Scenes paintings, and an area for worship. As the tallest surviving tower and the sole wooden pagoda in Korea, the Palsangjeon Hall holds immense historical and architectural significance.",

The upper pillars exhibit a creative design reminiscent of the stone railings at Bulguksa Temple's Dabotap Pagoda, preserving an archaic aesthetic. The lower railing wall is further embellished with intricate patterns, enhancing its ornate beauty.

During a 1917 restoration, relics and a Goryeo-era mirror were discovered in the sixth-story body and base, suggesting a secondary enshrinement during the Goryeo period. Though grand in scale, the pagoda appears less stable due to its height-to-width ratio, with some scholars attributing this to alterations made during Japanese colonial-era repairs, which may have compromised its original structural integrity and detailing.",

It is the oldest and most uniquely shaped stone structure carved with lions. Resting on an octagonal base, two lions face each other, pressing their chests together and standing on the lower stone with their hind legs, while supporting the upper stone with their front paws and muzzles. Lotus patterns are engraved on both the lower and upper stones, with the double-layered lotus design on the upper stone exuding an antique charm.

The octagonal fire chamber (hwasaseok) is tall with four openings to allow light to emanate. The roof stone, horizontal at the eaves but slightly uplifted at the eight corners, appears modest and stable due to its unadorned simplicity. Dated to 720 CE (19th year of King Seongdeok's reign), the lantern's proportions—though the roof stone appears slightly large—create a harmonious balance with the broad base, radiating a dignified grandeur. Unlike typical Unified Silla stone lanterns that used octagonal pillars, this innovative design substitutes them with twin lions, a pioneering approach that inspired later imitations.

Erected after Silla occupied the Goguryeo territory of Jeokseong, it was intended to stabilize the local populace. Discovered in 1978, the stele was found buried underground in a tilted state, with its inscription remarkably well-preserved. The stele is wide and thick at the top, narrowing and thinning toward the bottom. Though the upper portion is missing, both sides remain nearly intact, suggesting it was crafted from a natural stone with a freeform shape. The total number of characters is estimated at around 440, with 288 legible characters remaining today. The calligraphy aligns precisely with horizontal and vertical lines in each row, showcasing a rhythmic brushwork style transitioning from clerical script (Lishu) to regular script (Kaishu), making it a valuable resource for calligraphic studies. The inscription commends the people of Jeokseong who aided Silla's territorial expansion and pledged loyalty, while promising equal rewards to future loyalists. This reveals new insights into the development of Silla's legal system (Yulryeong), particularly regarding penal and administrative laws. It highlights that national laws on labor systems and property distribution were established early in King Jinheung's reign, with local customs of Jeokseong generalized into legal statutes. By comparing the ranks of ten high officials mentioned in the inscription with records from the Samguk Sagi, the stele is dated to between the 6th and 11th years of King Jinheung's reign (545–550 CE). Its placement in Jeokseong, a strategic stronghold for northern expeditions, reflects Silla's intent to affirm control over new territory and integrate subjugated Goguryeo populations. Though not a pure memorial stele (erected to commemorate a king's inspection tour), it holds significant value as a territorial expansion stele, embodying the spirit of such monuments.",

      "content_en": "This book is a handwritten diary composed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin (1545–1598) during the Imjin War (1592–1598), consisting of seven volumes organized by year. Yi Sun-sin failed the military selection exam (Hunlwon Byeol-gwa) at age 28 due to a horse accident but passed the civil service exam four years later, beginning his career as a government official. Renowned for his exceptional loyalty, literary talent, and poetic skills, he prepared for Japanese invasion as Commander of the Jeolla Left Naval District by constructing warships and strengthening military defenses in Yeosu. During the Imjin War, he achieved decisive victories at battles such as Okpo, Sacheon (where the Geobukseon turtle ship debuted), Danghangpo, and Hansan. In the Japanese re-invasion (Jeongyu Jaeran), he triumphed at Myeongnyang. Posthumously honored as a First-Class Meritorious Subject of Martial Valor in 1604, he was posthumously promoted to Prime Minister and granted the posthumous title 'Chungmu' (忠武). His unwavering loyalty, moral integrity, and leadership saved the nation from crisis, leaving an indelible legacy in Korean history.\n\nThe diary's structure includes: Volume 1 (Imjin Ilgi, 27 pages, May 1, 1592–March 1593), Volume 2 (Gyesha Ilgi, 30 pages, May–September 1593), Volume 3 (Gapo Ilgi, 52 pages, January–July 1594), Volume 4 (Byeongsin Ilgi, 41 pages, January–October 1596), Volume 5 (Jeongyu Ilgi, 27 pages, April–October 1597), Volume 6 (Jeongyu Ilgi Sok, 20 pages with partial overlap, August 1597–January 1598), and Volume 7 (Musun Ilgi, 8 pages, September–October 1598). Written intermittently during seven years of war, it was preserved by descendants for over 390 years. As the original draft of the diary included in Chungmu Gong Jeonseo, it contains detailed military strategies, naval control records, and drafts of battle reports, offering invaluable insights into Joseon's military system and wartime operations.",

      "content_en": "Enshrined in the Upper Daeungjeon Hall (Treasure) of Janggeosa Temple, located on Mount Chilgap in Cheongyang County, Chungcheongnam-do, this iron Buddha statue sits majestically on a massive square stone pedestal. The statue is backed by a wooden halo, replacing the original stone halo which was lost. The Buddha's usnisa (topknot) is modestly rendered, and the face exhibits a round, refined appearance. Though the body is robust and dignified, the lack of volumetric fullness and reduced elastic proportions suggest it was crafted in the late 9th century. The right hand touches the ground in a gesture of earth witness, while the left hand, originally holding a medicine vase (now missing), rests on the lap. The monastic robe, loosely draped over the left shoulder, features sparse and scattered folds.\n\nThe four-sided pedestal, far more grandiose than the statue itself, comprises three tiers: a broad, tall base; a relatively low and small middle tier; and an upper tier. The base stone is exceptionally wide, with traces of pillars at each corner, indicating the presence of an enclosed shrine space. The lower tier is adorned with inverted lotus patterns and large floral carvings at the corners. The middle tier features prominent eye-shaped motifs (ansang), while the upper tier displays blooming lotus patterns.\n\nThe wooden halo, likely a Joseon-era replacement for the original stone version, incorporates floral designs at the center and flame patterns around the edges, reflecting stylistic influences from the late Silla to early Goryeo periods. This statue is acclaimed as an outstanding example of early 10th-century Buddhist art, inheriting the late 9th-century style through its unique pedestal resembling a pagoda, niche-like structure, and elegant iron-casting technique.",

The reliquary measures 74 cm in height and 50 cm in width and length, featuring a circular top and a flat, tunnel-shaped base. The inner chamber, carved to a depth of approximately 45 cm, includes ledges suggesting the installation of a sarira apparatus and a door. Inscribed on both sides of the chamber are 10 characters each in a clerical script (隸書) style from China's Northern and Southern Dynasties. The epigraph reveals that the reliquary was created in 567 by King Chang (r. 554–598, also known as King Wideok), son of King Seong, to honor the sarira offered by a princess—daughter of King Seong and sister of King Chang. This artifact serves as a critical epigraphic resource for Baekje history, illustrating cultural exchanges between Baekje and China. Additionally, it is historically significant as the first confirmed case where the founding date of a Baekje temple is verified through contemporary artifacts, clarifying the chronology of Buddhist practices in the kingdom.",

The statue features a tall cylindrical crown atop neatly combed hair and holds a bronze lotus flower in both hands. Its broad, distinct facial features and unconventional, overwhelming scale exemplify a uniquely Korean aesthetic sensibility, diverging sharply from the refined idealism of Unified Silla sculpture.

These tablets, discovered alongside the tomb in 1971, serve as 'maejigwon' (land deed inscriptions) addressed to the earth deity, formalizing the acquisition of the tomb site. The king's stele measures 41.5 cm in width and 35 cm in height, with an inscription divided into six lines within a 5–6 cm border. Its text aligns with records from the Samguk Sagi. The reverse side features a square grid marking the 12 compass directions, though the western section is notably absent. The queen's stele, identical in size, bears a 4-line inscription within a 2.5–2.8 cm border, with the remaining 13 lines left blank. Its reverse side contains the land purchase text (maejimun). Originally created for King Muryeong's burial, the reverse was later reused to inscribe the queen's epitaph upon her interment. As the sole surviving 'maejigwon' from the Three Kingdoms period, these steles are invaluable for identifying tomb occupants and understanding Baekje burial practices.

      "content_en": "Designated as a Treasure in 1963, this Gilt-bronze Seated Bhaisajyaguru Buddha from Janggeosa Temple in Cheongyang gained further historical significance following the discovery of its votive inscription and enshrined relics. The inscription specifies the exact production date as 1346 (2nd year of King Chungmok's reign in Goryeo), establishing it as an absolute benchmark for studying late Goryeo Buddhist statues. The statue exemplifies the iconography of Bhaisajyaguru (Medicine Buddha) with a distinct medicine bowl mudra, while its head, facial features, and bodily proportions reflect the quintessential stylistic traits of 14th-century Buddhist sculpture. Notably, it showcases exceptional artistic craftsmanship and technical mastery, with minimal casting flaws both internally and externally. Unlike most late Goryeo statues linked to Amitabha Pure Land devotion, this is the only surviving gilt-bronze Bhaisajyaguru statue from the period, offering critical insights into both Amitabha and Bhaisajyaguru faith traditions. The enshrined relics include a votive text listing 1,116 patrons—the largest recorded in late Goryeo—providing invaluable data for reconstructing historical narratives due to the scarcity of contemporary documents. Among the patrons is Baegun Kyŏnghan (1298–1374), a key figure in the Goryeo Buddhist triad (alongside Naong Hyegeun and Taego Bou), whose previously obscure activities are now illuminated through this inscription. The patrons, including royal figures and lower-ranking military officials, likely commissioned the statue to pray for longevity and the salvation of relatives lost in Mongol invasions. Mongolian names like Bayan Temür (King Gongmin's Mongol name) and others in the list also attest to the cultural influence of the Yuan dynasty in 14th-century Korea. Accompanied by silk fragments with donor inscriptions, a high-quality incense pouch, and the votive text, this statue holds profound value not only in art history but also in Buddhist studies and social history, vividly capturing the era's religious, artistic, and socio-political landscape. These attributes collectively affirm its eligibility for national treasure status.",

The pagoda stands on a high terrace northwest of the temple, surrounded by pine forests, facing the stone lantern. It features a three-story tower body atop a two-tiered base. The lower base is adorned with protruding carvings of celestial beings (cheonin) playing musical instruments, holding flowers, and dancing in praise. The upper base, the most notable section, is supported by four lions—two male and two female—at each corner, all gazing forward with open mouths revealing sharp teeth. At the center, encircled by the lions, stands a monk in a praying posture, believed to represent Monk Yeon Gi's mother. Directly ahead, a kneeling monk statue faces the stone lantern, symbolizing Yeon Gi's profound filial piety as he offers tea to his mother while bearing the lantern.

At the center sits Amitabha Buddha, flanked by Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva on the left and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva on the right. Above the scene, six arhats are arranged in pairs on either side against a cloudy backdrop, with two small buddhas painted above them. The composition mirrors the enshrined Amitabha Triad statue in front. The central Buddha is seated cross-legged on a high lotus pedestal, draped in robes covering both shoulders, with a key-shaped halo behind. Avalokiteshvara, with flowing hair and a translucent outer robe, stands to the left, while Ksitigarbha on the right holds a monk’s staff in his right hand and a wish-fulfilling jewel in his left. The palette primarily uses green and red hues. Created in 1476 (7th year of King Seongjong’s reign) by the painter-monk Haeryeon, the mural retains Goryeo-era characteristics such as soft coloration and naturalistic body forms. Simultaneously, it exhibits early Joseon features like simplified patterns and figures proportionate to the main Buddha, making it a critical resource for studying the transition between Goryeo and early Joseon Buddhist art.",

The composition exemplifies a well-structured symmetry, with both upper and lower sections mirroring each other. The lower portion centers on the First Assembly, the 'Bodhi Field Assembly,' flanked by the 7th, 2nd, and 8th assemblies on the left and the 9th 'Seodarim Assembly' on the right. The upper section ascends from the 3rd 'Trayastrimsa Heaven Assembly' and 4th 'Yama Heaven Assembly' on the right to the 5th 'Tusita Heaven Assembly' and 6th 'Tahojai Heaven Assembly' on the left, maintaining balanced symmetry. The use of ochre, red, green, and gold on a mineral-pigmented silk ground, along with high-relief ornamentation on the jeweled adornments of the Buddha figures, reflects the vibrant aesthetic trends of 18th-century Buddhist painting. Notably, the lower register includes the 'Illustration of the Lotus Realm,' which visualizes the 39th chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra, where Samantabhadra Bodhisattva explains the pure land of Vairocana Buddha. Historical records indicate the painting was created in 1770 (46th year of King Yeongjo's reign) by 12 monk-artists led by Hwaryeon at Ansimsa Temple on Mount Mudeung, later relocated to Songgwangsa. As the earliest extant Joseon-era Avatamsaka Sutra illustration, it holds significant scholarly value for its meticulous and effective depiction of the sutra's doctrinal content.",

It holds historical significance as the central naval base that contributed to the victories in the Imjin and Jeongyu Wars, and retains its original form from its renovation in 1718 (44th year of King Sukjong's reign) by Naval Commander Lee Je-myeon. With a scale of 15 kan (bays) in width, 5 kan in depth, and a total area of 240 pyeong, it is the largest surviving local government building in Korea.\n\nThe structure's plan consists of 68 pillars. The inner pillars at the second bay on both eastern and western sides were relocated forward, treated as high pillars (goju) that directly support the main beam (jongbo). Cross beams (daeryang) are joined to these high pillars with bracket systems (pojak), and eave beams (tuibo) are placed above. Between the inner and outer pillars on the front and rear, simple eave brackets (tuiryang) are installed, while two cross beams (chungryang) on the side bays extend inward, their ends adorned with dragon-head carvings (yongdu) resting on the cross beams.\n\nThe pillars exhibit the min-heulrim tapering technique. Externally, the bracket system follows a multi-tiered (dapogui) style with two-tiered brackets (chumok) and decorative lotus-bud motifs, while internally it adopts a simpler ikong-style bracket system using overlapping wooden blocks (salmi). The front central pillars feature dragon-head brackets (yongmeori ikchogong). Each bay is accentuated with a floral bracket (hwanban), enhancing the façade's spatial composition. Original dancheong (traditional multicolored paintwork) patterns remain well-preserved on both interior and exterior elements.\n\nTo maximize interior space, the high pillars on both sides were set backward, optimizing functionality while maintaining structural integrity. The use of robust yet minimalist materials contributes to the building's grandeur. Additionally, two cross beams on the side façades ensure stability, reflecting advanced 18th-century architectural techniques. Despite its early 18th-century reconstruction, Yeosu Jinnamgwan exemplifies exceptional historical, academic, and artistic value.",

The set comprises one Yeongsanhoesangdo (Assembly on Vulture Peak Painting) and eight Pal Sangdo (Eight Scenes of the Buddha’s Life). Notably, the inscription on the Yeongsanhoesangdo uses the term 'Pal Sanghoe' (Eight Scenes Painting) instead of 'Hwabuldo' (Back Buddha Painting), emphasizing that this Yeongsanhoesangdo was produced as the central image alongside the Pal Sangdo series.\n\nThe Pal Sangdo depict eight pivotal events in the life of Sakyamuni Buddha. While the concept of the Eight Scenes was shared across Buddhist cultures, their thematic composition and iconography varied by region. In Korea, the specific sequence of the Eight Scenes—① Tosalraeuisang (Descent from Trayastrimsa Heaven), ② Biramgangsaengsang (Birth in Lumbini Garden), ③ Samunyugwangsang (Observing Suffering at the Four Gates), ④ Yuseongchulgasang (Leaving Home), ⑤ Seolsansudosang (Ascetic Practice in the Snow Mountains), ⑥ Suha Hangmasang (Subduing Mara under the Bodhi Tree), ⑦ Nokwonjeonbopsang (First Sermon in Deer Park), and ⑧ Ssangrimyeolbansang (Parinirvana in the Twin Groves)—was formally established in the early Joseon period, as illustrated in the iconic depictions of the *Worin Seokbo* (Moonlight Reflection on the Buddha’s Biography).\n\nDuring the late Joseon period, a new style of Pal Sangdo emerged, influenced by the *Seokssi Wonryu Eungwasajeok* (Chronicle of the Buddha’s Lineage and Manifestations). The Songgwangsa Pal Sangdo exemplifies this shift, with inscriptions confirming their creation in 1725 (1st year of King Yeongjo’s reign) under the lead painter Uigyeom (義謙).\n\nHoused in the Songgwangsa Seongbo Museum, this ensemble is the earliest known complete set of Yeongsanhoesangdo and Pal Sangdo enshrined together in a single hall. It reflects Joseon’s unique approach to visualizing the Buddha’s life through Buddhist art. Significantly, both the Yeongsanhoesangdo and Pal Sangdo employ iconography from the *Seokssi Wonryu Eungwasajeok*, forming a cohesive conceptual and artistic whole. This work not only highlights the diversity of late Joseon Yeongsanhoesangdo but also establishes a new paradigm for Pal Sangdo.

Created in 1635 (13th year of King Injo's reign) during the late Joseon period, these statues represent a collaborative masterpiece by renowned sculptors Cheongheon (also known as Cheongheon), Ungwon, In-gyun, and their disciples. They stand as a quintessential example of 17th-century Buddhist sculpture. The 'Trijang Buddha' refers to the three bodies of Buddha: Dharmakaya (Vairocana), Sambhogakaya (Rohmani), and Nirmanakaya (Sakyamuni), a iconography rooted in Hwaeom (Huayan) Buddhist thought. While commonly depicted in paintings or sutra illustrations, these statues are the only surviving sculptural representation of the Trijang Buddha, making them an indispensable case study in the history of post-Imjin War Buddhist ideology and sculpture. Recent discoveries of relic documents and inscriptions have clarified the production timeline (1634–1635), patrons, and participants. Commissioned during the temple's post-war reconstruction (1630–1636), the project was overseen by Monk Byeokam Gakseong (1575–1660), an influential figure who led the restoration of major temples devastated by the Imjin War. Notable patrons included Prince Uichang Lee Hwang (1589–1645), King Seonjo's eighth son, his spouse, Sin Ik-sung (1588–1644), King Seonjo's son-in-law, and 1,320 donors, including 580 monks. The statues, seated on elaborate lotus pedestals and octagonal wooden thrones, exceed 3 meters in height. Their monumental scale and robust, simplified lines reflect the sculptors' mastery. The Vairocana and Sakyamuni statues, with stern expressions, are attributed to Cheongheon's school, while the Rohmani statue, characterized by softer facial features and rounded eyelids, is linked to Ungwon and In-gyun. As the largest 17th-century wooden Buddhist statues and the sole sculptural Trijang Buddha ensemble, these works hold unparalleled significance in Buddhist art history, showcasing exceptional artistic and technical achievement.",

According to the Samguk Yusa (三國遺事), Kim Daeseong built Seokguram Grotto to honor his past-life parents and Bulguksa to honor his present-life parents. However, he did not live to see its completion, and the state later finished the temple, designating it as a site for national prayers. \n\nThe Dabotap Pagoda and Sakyamuni Pagoda (Three-story Stone Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple, National Treasure) are Korea's most representative stone pagodas, with similar heights of 10.29m and 10.75m, respectively. They face each other between Daeungjeon Hall and Jahamun Gate, with Dabotap located to the east. Dabotap represents a unique pagoda style, while Sakyamuni Pagoda exemplifies the conventional Korean stone pagoda form. Their symmetrical placement symbolizes the Lotus Sutra's narrative, where Prabhutaratna Buddha (the Buddha of the past) attests to the teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha (the Buddha of the present). \n\nUnlike Sakyamuni Pagoda, which clearly has a three-tier structure on a two-tiered base, Dabotap's layers are difficult to discern. Its cross-shaped base features stone staircases on all four sides, an octagonal tower body, and a square railing. Constructed around 751, the pagoda ingeniously integrates square, octagonal, and circular elements without appearing cluttered, reflecting the essence of 8th-century Unified Silla artistry. The uniform proportions of its components—length, width, and thickness—highlight its meticulous design. \n\nTragically, Dabotap bears the scars of Japanese colonial rule. Around 1925, Japanese authorities dismantled and restored the pagoda without documenting the process, resulting in the loss of relics, sarira, and related artifacts originally housed within. Additionally, three of the four stone lions that once guarded the base's staircases were looted during this period.

The robust two-tiered base is designed to bear the pagoda's weight, with carved pillar motifs at each corner mimicking wooden architecture. Similar pillars adorn the tower body, and the upturned corners of the roof stones impart a dynamic, soaring aesthetic.\n\nIn September 1966, the pagoda was damaged by tomb raiders.

These paintings, among the oldest extant polychrome works from the Goryeo period (excluding tomb murals), are now preserved at Buseoksa Temple's Seongbo Museum, with replicas installed in their original locations to convey their historical appearance.",

Hye-cheol received the posthumous title 'Jik-in' and the pagoda name 'Joryun Cheongjeong' from King Gyeongmun of Silla. After studying Seon Buddhism in Tang China (814), he returned to Korea and established the Dongri Mountain School centered at Taean Temple.  \n\nThis octagonal circular hall-style stupa features a distinct platform-style base with lion carvings of varying forms on the lower tier. The body stone imitates wooden architectural elements, including pillars and lintels, with intricate flat-carved depictions of a door panel and the Four Heavenly Kings. It exemplifies both dynamic and restrained sculptural techniques, showcasing exceptional proportional harmony and aesthetic refinement. The roof stone realistically replicates traditional Korean tiled-roof curves and timber structures, suggesting the work of master stonemasons of the era.  \n\nThe accompanying stele inscription clarifies the pagoda's construction date (861) and its association with Hye-cheol, making it a critical benchmark for dating Silla stone art. Notably, it is the only surviving Silla-era monk's stupa with a pagoda hall facility, evidenced by four remaining foundation stones. This underscores its historical and scholarly significance as a tangible record of devotional practices honoring the school's founding master.\"\n}",

      "content_en": "Seokguram Grotto was initiated in 751 (10th year of King Gyeongdeok's reign) by Kim Daeseong, a prominent figure of the Silla period, and completed in 774 (10th year of King Hyegong's reign). Originally named Seokbulsa, it stands as a masterpiece of Silla Buddhist art. King Gyeongdeok (r. 742–765) presided over a golden age of Buddhist culture, during which other iconic heritage sites like Bulguksa Temple, Dabotap Pagoda, Three-story Stone Pagoda, and Hwangnyongsa Bell were also created.\n\nCarved into the slopes of Tohamsan Mountain using white granite, the grotto features an artificial stone chamber. The structure comprises a rectangular antechamber (jeonsil) connected by a corridor to a circular main chamber (jushil), with the latter's dome crafted from 360 interlocking stone slabs—a globally unparalleled architectural feat. Though originally housing 40 statues, only 38 remain today.\n\nThe antechamber displays eight guardian deities (four on each side), while the corridor entrance features Vajra guardians and the Four Heavenly Kings. The main chamber, supported by octagonal pillars, enshrines the principal Buddha (Shakyamuni) slightly rearward of the center. Its walls depict two celestial beings, two bodhisattvas, ten arhats, and the intricately carved Eleven-Headed Kwanum Bodhisattva behind the main statue.\n\nRenowned for its mature sculptural techniques and lifelike expressions, Seokguram's artworks—including the serene main Buddha, the ornate Eleven-Headed Kwanum, dynamic Vajra guardians, imposing Heavenly Kings, graceful bodhisattvas, and individualistic arhats—are considered pinnacles of East Asian Buddhist sculpture. The grotto's harmonious integration of architecture, mathematics, religion, and art earned it National Treasure status and UNESCO World Heritage designation (jointly with Bulguksa) in 1995. Due to preservation concerns, public viewing through glass barriers has been implemented since 1976.",

      "content_en": "The Gyeongju Bulguksa Temple Bronze Seated Vairocana Buddha Statue, housed in Birojeon Hall of Bulguksa Temple at the foot of Tohamsan Mountain in Gyeongju, was created in 751 (10th year of King Gyeongdeok's reign during the Unified Silla period) under the patronage of Kim Daeseong. According to the Samguk Yusa, Kim Daeseong founded Bulguksa to honor his parents in the present life and Seokguram Grotto to honor his parents from a past life. This 1.77-meter-tall statue embodies Vairocana Buddha, who symbolizes the universal truth encompassing all realms. The Buddha's hair is styled in small spiral curls, and the face exudes both majesty and compassion. The thin robe drapes only over the left shoulder, with natural, realistic folds cascading downward. Notably, the hand gesture (mudra) reverses the typical Vairocana pose: the right index finger is clasped by the left hand. The statue exemplifies the idealized and refined aesthetics of Unified Silla Buddhist sculpture through its sense of volume, proportional harmony, and craftsmanship. Alongside the Gyeongju Bulguksa Temple Bronze Seated Amitabha Buddha (National Treasure) and the Gyeongju Baekryulsa Temple Bronze Standing Bhaisajyaguru Buddha, it is celebrated as one of the 'Three Great Bronze Buddhas of Unified Silla.'",

      "content_en": "The Rock-carved Seated Buddha Statue at Buk Mireuksam Hermitage of Daeheungsa Temple, Haenam, is a high-relief carving on a rock face depicting a Buddha in the earth-touching mudra (降魔觸地印) accompanied by a celestial figure offering worship. This rare and exceptional example among Korean rock-carved buddhas is notable for its large scale, voluminous form, and refined craftsmanship. The Buddha’s head features a prominent usnisa (肉髻), appearing initially bald but with traces of curled hair. The face, though plump and round with composed facial features, conveys a stern expression through slightly upturned eyes and a tightly closed mouth. The large, elongated ears reach the shoulders, and the thick, short neck is marked by three lines symbolizing the tridharma (三道).\n\nThe statue assumes the earth-touching mudra with the right foot placed on the left knee in an auspicious posture (吉祥坐). The delicate, slender fingers and toes are realistically rendered, enhancing the statue’s graceful appearance. The monastic robe (法衣), covering both shoulders (通肩衣), features evenly spaced linear carvings that lack realism, while the drapery flowing between the knees is stylized, reflecting transitional techniques from the late Unified Silla to the Goryeo period.\n\nThe lotus pedestal (蓮花臺座) comprises 11 upward-facing (仰蓮) and 12 downward-facing (覆蓮) petals, thickly carved to emphasize volume. Uniquely, the central core (子房) rises prominently. The halo (光背), composed of three concentric circles, is adorned with flame patterns (火焰紋) along the upper edge and flanked symmetrically by four celestial figures (天人像). Unlike the somewhat rigid main Buddha, these celestial figures evoke the elegance of the bodhisattvas in Seokguram Grotto, showcasing softness and sophistication. Their carving technique is regarded as a masterpiece reflecting the period’s unique artistic excellence.",

      "content_en": "This 1.77m-tall standing gilt-bronze statue of Bhaisajyaguru Buddha, symbolizing the healer of all ailments, was relocated from Baengnyulsa Temple on Somanggang Mountain in northern Gyeongju to the Gyeongju National Museum in 1930. The Buddha's head is proportionally modest compared to the body, with a rounded face, long eyebrows, slender eyes, a prominent nose, and small mouth that convey an elegant yet less tense and dynamic expression than the idealized 8th-century Buddhist imagery. Despite the slightly slender shoulders, the drapery clinging to the body accentuates natural contours. The robe, covering both shoulders, flows over the arms, with a knot visible at the chest. The U-shaped frontal folds are rendered in repetitive, somewhat schematic lines. The lower body gains robustness, with heavy drapery complementing the slightly reclined upper torso and the naturally raised lower abdomen—a distinctive feature of this statue. Though the hands are missing, their original positions suggest the right hand was raised with an open palm, while the left likely held a medicine bowl or wish-fulfilling jewel. Despite its somewhat flat appearance, the harmonious proportions and refined craftsmanship earned it recognition as a National Treasure. Alongside the Gilt-bronze Seated Vairocana Buddha in Bulguksa Temple and the Gilt-bronze Seated Amitabha Buddha in Bulguksa Temple, it is celebrated as one of the Three Great Gilt-bronze Buddhas of the Unified Silla period.",

Its round, benevolent face gazes straight ahead, with semicircular eyebrows and a sharply defined nose. The body exudes a robust, masculine physique, with wide knees providing a stable base.

The left hand, raised to shoulder height, reveals an open palm, while the right hand rests on the knee with the thumb and middle finger slightly bent. The broad shoulders, voluminous chest, and slender waist reflect the realistic yet refined aesthetic of Unified Silla Buddhist statues.
